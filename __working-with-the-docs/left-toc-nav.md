# Left nav (TOC)

The left nav is handled through these files:

* **_source/_data/toc.yml**: Structure of the toc, page titles, and links. See this file for usage.
* **_source/_includes/left-toc.html**: Liquid templating of the toc, using data from toc.yml. Unless you're changing the template, no reason to touch.
* **_source/js/logz-docs.js**: Expand/collapse behavior of the toc.
