# This data gets populated in the logzio-icons.css file.
#
# AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON HOW THIS FILE IS ORGANIZED
#   This yaml is organized by character escape sequence, alphanumerically. This
#   keeps us from duplicating characters that we didn't know were there. If you
#   don't keep the file organized this way, chaos will ensue.
#
# Here's the structure for each item:
#   - escape-sequence: REQUIRED. unicode escape sequence
#     class: REQUIRED. css class name for this character
#     additional-css: |
#       Optional, but the pipe is required to make it multi-line.
#       Allows you to give additional CSS properties to an element, like
#       padding or font size. Must include valid CSS syntax, and end with
#       a semicolon. For example:
#       padding-left: .2rem;
#       padding-right: .2rem;
