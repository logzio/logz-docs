# This YAML feeds the "ship your data" page.
# There are 2 root-level objects: `tabs` and `tags`

# Tabs is an array that contains the collections to be included in the shipping page.
# Each array item is a single entry like this - `collection: <collection-name>`
# The collection name has to match a collection that's declared in Jekyll's _config.yml (in the `collections` object)
# This will support future data types — like traces — when we're ready to make a collection for it.
# So when you're ready to add a collection in the future, follow these steps:
#   1. Add the collection to the config yaml
#   2. Make a folder with the same name in the logzio_collections/ folder
#   3. Add that collection here, in the `tabs` object.
# Keep in mind there are other collections as well, so not all collections are included in this file.

# The community-shippers collection links out to shippers and projects that we don't maintain.

tabs:
  - collection: log-sources
  - collection: metrics-sources
  - collection: shippers
  - collection: community-shippers

# Tags is an array of tags that can be filtered on the data shipping page.
# Each item in the array contains two properties:
#   `slug: <kebab-cased-machine-readable-tag>` (lowercase, dashes only, no other characters)
#   `name: <human readable name for this tag>` (This will be displayed in the docs)
# Tags are used as an ID, so it's best to avoid changing slugs. Users will never see the slug.
# If you want to change the way it's displayed in the docs, change the `name`.
