Logz.io Metrics lets your team curate dashboards to oversee continuous deployment, CI/CD pipelines, prevent outages, manage incidents, and remediate crashes in multi-microservice environments, hybrid infrastructures, and complex tech stacks.

If you're an admin for the main account, you can manage the main account and sub accounts from the [**Manage Accounts**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page (**<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts** in the navigation menu).


The Infrastructure Monitoring plan panel is located at the bottom of the **[Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts)** page.

If you don't have an Infrastructure Monitoring account yet,
reach out to your account manager or email [the Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).

#### View plan summary

Your Metrics account is calculated according to the unique metrics (UMs) you're using. These metrics are a combination of the metric type queries by PromQL, including counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries.

You can view your daily and monthly available UMs, and a breakdown of each account’s current month’s allocations and usage percentages.

#### Configure which accounts can access a Metrics data source

Each Metrics account can become a data source for other Logz.io Metrics accounts. To manage access to your metrics data, you create an access list of the Logz.io main account and sub accounts that can view the data for each Metrics account. In the account selector, you can see the list of all the sub accounts (and main account) in the top right of the application page.

If users are logged in to the accounts you add here, they'll be able to read the metrics in this account.

1. Click the account name to open its account details.

2. To enable access to a Metrics data source for other accounts, click Add an account and select the relevant accounts in the field below the Metrics account name.
