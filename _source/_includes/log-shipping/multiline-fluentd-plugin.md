### Configuring Fluentd to concatenate multiline logs using a plugin

Fluentd splits multiline logs by default. If your original logs span multiple lines, you may find that they arrive in your Logz.io account split into several partial logs.

The Logz.io Docker image comes with a pre-built Fluentd filter plug-in that can be used to concatenate multiline logs. The plug-in is named `fluent-plugin-concat` and you can view the full list of configuration options in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery/fluent-plugin-concat).

###### Example

The following is an example of a multiline log sent from a deployment on a k8s cluster:

```shell
2021-02-08 09:37:51,031 - errorLogger - ERROR - Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./code.py", line 25, in my_func
1/0
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Fluentd's default configuration will split the above log into 4 logs, 1 for each line of the original log. In other words, each line break (`\n`) causes a split.

To avoid this, you can use the `fluent-plugin-concat` and customize the configuration to meet your needs. The additional configuration is added to:

* `kubernetes.conf` for RBAC/non-RBAC DaemonSet
* `kubernetes-containerd.conf` for Containerd DaemonSet

For the above example, we could use the following regex expressions to demarcate the start and end of our example log:


```shell
<filter **>
  @type concat
  key message # The key for part of multiline log
  multiline_start_regexp /^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/ # This regex expression identifies line starts.
</filter>
```
