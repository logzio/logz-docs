This {{include.service}} integration is specifically designed to work with the
destination bucket to which {{include.service}} writes its logs.

It is based on {{include.service}}'s naming convention and path structure.

If you're looking to ship {{include.service}} from a different bucket, please use the [S3 Bucket shipping](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/data-sources/S3-Bucket) method instead.
