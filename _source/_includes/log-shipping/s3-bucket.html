This {{include.service}} integration is designed to work with the
destination bucket to which {{include.servic}} writes its logs. 

It is based on {{include.service}}'s naming convention and path structure.
If you're interested in shipping logs from an S3 bucket from another destination, you can use the S3 Bucket shipping method.
