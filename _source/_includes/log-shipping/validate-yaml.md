##### Download and validate the file

When you're done adding your sources, click **Make the config file** to download it.

You can compare it to our [sample configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logz-docs/master/shipping-config-samples/logz-filebeat-config.yml) if you have questions.

If you've edited the file manually, it's a good idea to run it through a YAML validator to rule out indentation errors, clean up extra characters, and check if your yml file is valid. ([Yamllint.com](http://www.yamllint.com/) is a great choice.)
