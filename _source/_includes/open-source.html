*   This include is called if:
*     - The page has `open-source` in the frontmatter, or
*     - The {% include %} tag includes `title` parameter
*
*   If `open-source` is in page frontmatter, the open source note is shown at
*   the top of the page, just below the page flags.
*   It needs this structure:
*     open-source:
*       title: <project title>
*       github-repo: <github repo name (last part of repo url)>
*
*   If you need to show the message inside the page (for example, beneath
*   tabs), then write an {% include %} tag with `title` and `github-repo`
*   params. IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE TITLE, THE NOTE WON'T SHOW UP ON THE PAGE.
*   Call it like so:
*     {% include open-source.html title="<project title>" github-repo="<repo name>" %}
*         {%- endcomment -%}
