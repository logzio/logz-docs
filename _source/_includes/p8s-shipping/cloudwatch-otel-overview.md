Within the applications included in the Docker compose file: 

1. The logzio/cloudwatch-config-builder writes your environment data to configuration files shared with both the CloudWatch exporter and the OpenTelemetry collector containers. 
    
    The configuration files specify: 

    * Which data is collected
    * Which data is exposed
    * To which endpoints the data is sent

1. The CloudWatch exporter and OpenTelemetry collector containers use the configuration files to export and move the metrics data to Logz.io as follows:

    a. Via API, the CloudWatch exporter fetches the requested metrics data collected by CloudWatch from the AWS services in your platform and exposes these metrics to the designated endpoint.

    b. The OpenTelemetry collector receives the data via a metrics pipeline and sends it to Logz.io for ingestion.

### **Note:** 
* Extra calls and charges on AWS API requests may be generated by this project. 

* You can track the number of AWS API requests with the `cloudwatch_requests_total` metric, which provides labels with the API name and namespace specification. For example : 
`cloudwatch_requests_total{action="getMetricStatistics",namespace="AWS/EC2",} 876.0`.
