*   This file goes in your Jekyll _includes/ folder. It prevents orphan words
*   by replacing the last space in the string with a non-breaking space.
*
*   Usage:
*   Pass `str` (a string) to this include. Returns the string with last space
*   replaced with `&nbsp;`.
*
*   Example:
*     {%- include prevent_orphan_words.html str="You can call me Al." -%}
*   Results in:
*     "You can call me&nbsp;Al."
*         {%- endcomment -%}
