You'll be taken to the Kibana Discover view, filtered by the alert ID for the last 36 hours. You can easily adjust the time picker to filter for another time frame.

Each log document represents an event, when the alert's query and triggering conditions were met. Click the **Investigate** button on a select event to drill down on the raw logs that caused the alert to trigger.
