*   USAGE
*   ==========
*   Call this page in an `include` tag.
*
*   To get everything into one big array:
*     assign <allPages> = htmlPages
*       | concat: shippingDataSources
*
*   Otherwise, filter htmlPages and shippingDataSources as needed, and then go
*   from there.
*         {%- endcomment -%}

{%- comment -%}
* Initialize empty arrays
*         {%- endcomment -%}
{%- assign shippingDataSources = "" | split: "" -%}

{%- comment -%}
*   shippingDataSources is a placeholder for the log-sources collection.
*   If Jekyll can't find log-sources, it defaults to an empty array
*   (initialized above) so it doesn't break the remaining code.
*
*   shippingDataSources is used for the rest of this doc, so if you add
*   more data sources in the future, add them to shippingDataSources with
*   `concat: <COLLECTION-NAME>`. Leave the default last.
