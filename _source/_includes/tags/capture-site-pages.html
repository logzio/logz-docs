*   shippingDataSources is a placeholder for the data-sources collection.
*   If Jekyll can't find data-sources, it defaults to an empty array
*   (initialized above) so it doesn't break the remaining code.
*
*   shippingDataSources is used for the rest of this doc, so if you add
*   more data sources in the future, add them to shippingDataSources with
*   `concat: <COLLECTION-NAME>`. Leave the default last.
