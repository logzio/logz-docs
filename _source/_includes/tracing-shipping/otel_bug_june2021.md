**Known Issue, June 2021**: OpenTelemetry collector version 0.24 and above does not function as expected when deployed with the Logz.io exporter. To remediate this issue, if youâ€™re currently using version 0.24 or above, replace your  OpenTelemetry collector with version 0.23 or lower.
The resolution for this issue is in development and is expected later this year.
