Replace `<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` with the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/data-shipping?product=tracing) of the account you want to ship to.

If your account is hosted in any region other than `us`, replace `LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>` with the applicable [region code](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions).
