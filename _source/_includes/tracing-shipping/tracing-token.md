You must have admin permissions for the Logz.io account to view the **Manage accounts** page. If you're not an admin user for the account, consult with an account admin to get the Distributed Tracing token information. 

   From your main account, go to the <a href="https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts" target ="_blank"> **Manage accounts** page</a> of your Operations workspace. <br> It can be reached by selecting **<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts**.

   Scroll to the Distributed Tracing account section and click the account you want to ship to.

   The account's token and other settings are displayed when you click the relevant tracing account name at the bottom of the section.
