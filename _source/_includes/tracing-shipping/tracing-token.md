You must have admin permissions for the Logz.io account to view the **Manage tokens** page. If you're not an admin user for the account, consult with an account admin to get the Distributed Tracing token information. 

   1. When you're logged into your main account, from the  **Settings <i class="li li-gear"></i>** menu, go to the <a href="https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/data-shipping" target ="_blank"> **Manage tokens** page</a>, open the **Data shipping tokens** tab, and select the **Tracing** option. 

   2. Find the Distributed Tracing account you want to ship to in the table, and copy the token. 
   For information about how to manage your tracing data sources, see [Manage a Distributed Tracing account](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/manage-the-distributed-tracing-account/).
