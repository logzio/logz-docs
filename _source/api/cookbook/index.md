Welcome!

In the API cookbook, you'll find some ideas to help you get started with the Logz.io API.

If you want to use the Logz.io API, you’ll need to be on an Pro account.
If you’re not on an Pro account, no worries!
You can sign up for a free 14-day trial, but you’ll need to ask for API access.
To make the request, <a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">contact the Support team</a>.
