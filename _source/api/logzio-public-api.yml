      You can manage your API tokens from the [Logz.io API tokens](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/api) page.


      API tokens are account-specific. You will need to be logged into the relevant Log Management or SIEM account to view the API tokens associated with it.


      To manage your API tokens, log into the relevant account in your Logz.io platform, click the gear in the top-right menu, and select [**Tools > Manage tokens > API tokens**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/api).


      It's important to keep your tokens secure. API tokens carry privileges to make changes to users and accounts, so if you believe an API token has been compromised, delete it, and replace it with a new token in your integrations.

  - name: Metrics gateway
    description: Metrics API Gateway to supported endpoints. In the context of this API, "*Grafana*" refers to the Logz.io fork of Grafana, thus this gateway provides support for the APIs of the Logz.io fork of Grafana and for some of the open source Grafana APIs. Read more about the fork created by Logz.io [here.](https://logz.io/about-us/forked-statement/)

  - name: Who am I
  - name: Manage time-based log accounts
    description: >-
      Use these API requests to manage time-based log accounts:
      
      * Create, update, or delete a sub account.

      * Allocate daily capacity to the main account and/or sub accounts.
      
      * Retrieve account activity stats and/or account configuration details.


      ### Flexible storage & shared volume
        
      Flexible storage and shared volume allow accounts to share indexing capacity.
      
      
      To enable shared volume, go to the [Manage accounts page](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) in the Logz.io app and toggle the button **Use flexible volume** to turn it on.
      
      
      To determine whether flexible storage is enabled, run a `Get` request to retrieve account details.
      
      * If `isFlexible` is true, flexible storage is enabled and every account has reserved capacity set by the parameter `reservedDailyGB`.
      
      * If false, flexible storage is disabled and the parameter `reservedDailyGB` is null.
  - name: Search logs
    description: >-
      Use the Elasticsearch Search API DSL query language to search your Logz.io data.


      To ensure system performance and data availability, we've introduced some limitations to the original Elasticsearch specification. These limitations are detailed in the applicable API calls below.
  
  - name: Deployments
    description: >-
      Send deployment logs by API to automatically correlate exceptions with service deployments directly in your Logz.io Exceptions tab. The API endpoints documented here are in Beta, and are subject to change.

  - name: Insights
    description: >-
      Logz.io monitors your logs for Insights to help you preempt issues and alert you of potential problems.


      There are two types of Insights:

      * LOGCEPTION - Application errors and exceptions identified in the stack trace.

      * PUBLIC_CI - Cognitive Insights correlate your logs with  vulnerabilities and issues that are trending in the open source community.


      You have the option to set up an alert so you can get notified of the details when new or recurring insights are spotted in your system.


      **Note:** This endpoint requires permissions that must be set by our Support team. Please email [help@logz.io](mailto:help@logz.io) for assistance.
  - name: Retrieve audit trail
  - name: Connect to CloudTrail
    description: Establish a connection to ship logs to the Logz.io observability platform via an S3 bucket. Supports CloudTrail logs.
  - name: Connect to S3 Buckets
    description: >-
      Establish a connection for the Logz.io fetcher to fetch logs to the Logz.io observability platform via an S3 bucket. Supports ELB, S3 Access, CloudFront, VPC Flow logs.


      If you're looking to fetch CloudTrail logs, use the designated endpoints.


      Authentication can be established with either S3 secret credentials or ARNs (for AWS IAM Roles). Authentication with S3 Secret Credentials is supported for backward compatibility. Authentication with ARNs (for IAM Roles) is strongly recommended.
  - name: Manage notification endpoints
    description: >-
      Logz.io can send notifications to your preferred workspaces, such as Opsgenie, BigPanda, PagerDuty, and Slack.


      Notifications are typically sent when alerts are triggered, when a user shares a Kibana object,
      or when Logz.io Insights identifies new exceptions in your logs.


      Use these API endpoints to create, update, or delete notification endpoints. If you configure a custom endpoint,
      you can configure the notification message body.
      Otherwise, you can use any of the available preconfigured endpoints.
  - name: Import or export Kibana objects
  - name: Manage log shipping tokens
    description: >-
      Use these API endpoints to create, update, retrieve, or delete log shipping tokens.
  - name: Drop filters
    description: >-
      Drop filters provide a solution for filtering out logs before they are indexed in your account to help lower costs and reduce account volume.


      Drop filters evaluate logs for exact field:value matches. Any log results that match active drop filters will not be indexed. This means they will not appear in your Kibana account, will not be searchable, trigger alerts, or appear in dashboards.


      Archiving is not affected by drop filters. Logs dropped by drop filters will still be archived, if archiving is configured for the account. With archiving configured, you can readily use drop filters to reduce logging bulk and restore the logs in the event that they become relevant.
  - name: Manage shared tokens
    description: >-
      You can share Kibana visualization and dashboard snapshots using shared tokens.
      Token filters are available to help you control what data to expose.


      **Note:** Shared token endpoints require permissions that must be set by our Support team. Please email help@logz.io for assistance.
  - name: Manage API tokens
    description: >-
      You can manage API tokens for sub accounts.
  - name: Logz.io snapshots
  - name: Manage users
  - name: Alerts
    description: >-
      Logz.io alerts use a Kibana search query to continuously scan your logs and alert you when a certain set of conditions is met. The simplest alerts can use a simple search query or a particular filter, but others can be quite complex and involve several conditions with varying thresholds.


      When alerts trigger, they write event logs. Event logs of triggered alerts are always available and searchable in Kibana - just filter for `_exists_:logzio-alert`. But you also have the option to add notifications, and control their contents, format, and who they are sent to.


      For the deprecated alerting version, please see our [public GitHub project](https://github.com/logzio/public-api/tree/master/alerts).
  - name: Security rules
    description: >-
      Security rules help you connect the dots between your data sources and events that could indicate a security threat or breach.


      Your Cloud SIEM account comes pre-configured with security rules for different attack types and security use cases. These built-in rules are protected, and there are limitations on the changes that can be made to them. Pre-configured rules can be updated by adding notification endpoints (like email or Slack), changing trigger thresholds and severities, and adding tags, as described in detail in the endpoint.


      You can also create new security rules to supplement the built-in rules.
  - name: Security events
    description: >-
      A security event is logged whenever a security rule triggers in your [Logz.io Cloud SIEM account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/rules/rule-definitions?from=0&sortBy=updatedAt&sortOrder=DESC).


      Your Logz.io Cloud SIEM is pre-loaded with hundreds of security rules created and maintained by Logz.io's security analysts. The list continues to be expanded and updated on a regular basis. You can also add your own security rules.


      To investigate into security events, you can begin by running a bulk query to fetch security event logs, either with or without applying filtering criteria. This query returns all of the events that match the query parameters and can potentially fetch events going back many months. Whenever you encounter a particular event you would like to further investigate, you can run the drilldown query to fetch the logs that triggered the security event to delve deeper into the event details.


      These queries can be used to integrate with an automated response solution such as Cortex xSOAR or simply to understand your security posture and identify suspicious activity in your accounts.
  - name: Archive logs
    description: >-
      You can archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage. Archiving gives you the option to restore logs and query them after they have expired from your time-based account.


      You can use the following endpoints to retrieve, set up, test, and update an account's archive settings.


      Note: Logs are archived before they are indexed and analyzed by Logz.io. If you are using drop filters, note that dropped logs will still be archived.
  - name: Restore logs
    description: >-
      You can restore data from your active archiving account, whether an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage. Restoring data gives you the option to query logs after they have expired from your time-based account.


      You can use the following endpoints to initiate a new restore process, retrieve, set up, test, and update an account's archive settings.


      Note: Logs that are dropped by drop filters are still archived and can be restored. You can temporarily disable drop filters to restore the data.
  - name: Lookups
    description: >-
      Lookups are custom lists of values that allow you to easily filter by large lists in Kibana.

      
      Instead of adding a long list of elements to your query, you can create lookup lists and filter by them using the operators `in lookups`/`not in lookups`.
      
      
      For this purpose, all of the values in a lookup list should be mapped to the same field in Kibana. [Learn more in the user guide](/user-guide/lookups/)

        **Maximum results:** This call returns up to 10,000 results per query for aggregated results, or 1,000 results for non-aggregated results. 


        **Note:** To ensure speed and availability of your logs, we restrict some options from the Elasticsearch defaults that could hamper system performance. Restrictions are described with their respective elements below.

              For example, if set to `5`, search returns results from 5 days ago and 4 days ago, UTC.


              Maximum is your account's retention period.


              If set to `0` or `1`, search returns default results (today and yesterday, UTC).

              ID of the sub account to search.
              By default, only this account is searched.


              A main account can search a sub account as long as it has the right permissions.
              To give search permissions to the main account,
              log in to the main account,
              go to the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page,
              and select **Searchable from the main account** for the intended sub account.


              To include multiple accounts, repeat this parameter for each account
              (for example: `accountIds=500&accountIds=600`).


              **Important**:
              If you include an account without the right permissions,
              the request will fail.


              If you include this parameter, the current account won't be searched
              unless you explicitly include it in the query.

                  The query can take any of the parameters described in the [Elasticsearch Search API DSL documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/search.html) with the exceptions stated below.

                  #### Limitations

                  * When using `query_string`, `allow_leading_wildcard` must be set to `false`

                  * `wildcard` can't start with `*` or `?`

                  * Can't contain `fuzzy_max_expansions`, `max_expansions`, or `max_determinized_states`


                  #### Notes on the search time range

                  * By default, your query runs on data sent today and yesterday, UTC.
                    You can move this 2-calendar-day window by using the `dayOffset` query parameter.

                  * Searches without a `timestamp` filter will return 2 calendar days, UTC.
                    To search a different time frame, specify a filter on `timestamp`.

                example: { "bool": { "must": [{ "range": { "@timestamp": { "gte": "now-5m", "lte": "now" } } }] } }

                  * When using the `size` element, the value must be ≤ `1000`

                  * Can't nest 2 or more bucket aggregations of these types: `date_histogram`, `geohash_grid`, `histogram`, `ip_ranges`, `significant_terms`, `terms`

                  * Can't sort or aggregate on analyzed fields, such as the `message` field

                  * Aggregation type `significant_terms` can't be used


                  **Note:** You can use `aggs` or `aggregations` as the field name
                example: { "byType": { "terms": { "field": "type", "size": 5 } } }

      tags:

      description: >-
        This endpoint can take 2 types of call requests. The first type runs a search query that returns a `scrollID` and the first batch of paginated results. The second request type passes only the `scroll_id`
        (The variation in the field name is intentional) to fetch the next batches of paginated results.
        This endpoint always returns results as a stringified JSON.


        How it works:


        First, send a request to establish the `scrollID`. This initial request contains the query object and additional parameters, similar to the `v1/search` endpoint, with the exception that `dayOffset` and `accountIds` are not supported. The request will return the field `scrollId` and the number of `hits`, representing the number of matching results.


        Next, send the `scroll_id` in the request body to retrieve the log results as a stringified JSON. Each call returns the next page, where each page can return a maximum of 1000 results. Every time you resend the same `scroll_id` in the request body, it returns the next page until it reaches the end of the results.
        
        
        Every time you send the request with the same `scroll_id`, the next batch of results is returned.
        Keep sending the same scroll ID as many times as needed to retrieve all of the available results.
        The results are paginated, and every request returns the next page, one at a time.


        When the call returns an empty array, you'll know you've reached the end of your results.


        **Note**:


        * Send the field `scroll_id` in requests (snake_case).

        * Receive the field `scrollID` in your responses (camelCase).

          * The query can only run on 2 consecutive indexes. By default, the query runs on data sent today and yesterday. You can also add a filter on `timestamp` to search a smaller time frame.

          * When using `query_string`, `allow_leading_wildcard` must be set to `false` to disable leading wildcards. In other words, the query can't start with `*` or `?`

          The time frame for evaluating the log data is a sliding window, with 1 minute granularity.


          The recommended minimum and maximum values are not validated, but needed to guarantee the rule's accuracy.


          The minimum recommended time frame is 5 minutes, as anything shorter will be less reliable and unnecessarily resource-heavy.


          The maximum recommended time frame is 1440 minutes (24 hours). The rule runs on the index from today and yesterday (in UTC) and the maximum time frame increases throughout the day, reaching 48 hours exactly before midnight UTC.
