    # Introduction

    This API is documented using the **OpenAPI 2.0** specification.
    <!-- You can browse the API documentation on this page, or you can download the specification file. -->


    ### Updates and improvements

    We update this document regularly to reflect changes and improvements to the Logz.io API.
    If you'd like to suggest corrections or improvements to this document, please <a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">contact the Support team</a> or submit a ticket in the [docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/logzio/logz-docs/issues).


    # Account region and API URL

    To find your account region, sign in to Logz.io and look at the URL in the address bar.
    Your API URL has the same two-letter code that you see in the address bar when you're logged in.


    For more information, see [Account region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html).


    # Authentication

    The Logz.io API is available to Pro and Enterprise plan subscribers.
    You can generate and delete API tokens in your [Logz.io account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/api).

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->


    # Rate limiting

    API call and response rates are limited.
    To find out your rate limits or request changes to your plan, please contact your account manager or the <a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">Customer Success Team</a>.

      To get to this page, click the gear in the top menu, and then select [**Tools > API tokens**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/api-tokens).


      API tokens carry privileges to make changes to users and accounts,
      so it's important to keep your tokens secure. If you believe an API token has been compromised,
      delete the compromised token, and replace it with a new token in your integrations.

      We are in the process of rolling out [flexible volume plan configuration](/user-guide/accounts/flexible-volume.html). A new beta feature.
      
      
      * If your account has the option to switch to flexible volume, please refer to the updated [documentation](/beta-api-flexible-storage/) for the beta API.

  - name: Search logs
    description: >-
      Use the Elasticsearch Search API DSL query language to search your Logz.io data.


      To ensure system performance and data availability, we've introduced some limitations to the original Elasticsearch specification. These limitations are detailed in the applicable API calls below.
  - name: Insights
    description: >-
      Logz.io monitors your logs for Insights to help you preempt issues and alert you of potential problems.
      
      
      There are two types of Insights:

      * LOGCEPTION - Application errors and exceptions identified in the stack trace.

      * PUBLIC_CI - Cognitive Insights correlate your logs with  vulnerabilities and issues that are trending in the open source community.


      You have the option to set up an alert so you can get notified of the details when new or recurring insights are spotted in your system.
  - name: Retrieve audit trail
  - name: Connect to CloudTrail
    description: Establish a connection to ship logs to the Logz.io observability platform via an S3 bucket. Supports CloudTrail logs.
  - name: Connect to S3 Buckets
    description: >-
      Establish a connection for the Logz.io fetcher to fetch logs to the Logz.io observability platform via an S3 bucket. Supports ELB, S3 Access, CloudFront, VPC Flow logs.
      
      
      If you're looking to fetch CloudTrail logs, use the designated endpoints.


      Authentication can be established with either S3 secret credentials or ARNs (for AWS IAM Roles). Authentication with S3 Secret Credentials is supported for backward compatibility. Authentication with ARNs (for IAM Roles) is strongly recommended.
  - name: Manage notification endpoints
    description: >-
      Logz.io can send notifications to your preferred workspaces, such as Opsgenie, BigPanda, PagerDuty, and Slack.


      Notifications are typically sent when alerts are triggered, when a user shares a Kibana object,
      or when Logz.io Insights identifies new exceptions in your logs.


      Use these API endpoints to create, update, or delete notification endpoints. If you configure a custom endpoint,
      you can configure the notificaton message body.
      Otherwise, you can use any of the available preconfigured endpoints.
  - name: Import or export Kibana objects
  - name: Manage log shipping tokens
    description: >-
      Use these API endpoints to create, update, retrieve, or delete log shipping tokens.
  - name: Drop filters
    description: >-
      Drop filters offer a great way to filter out logs from an account to help manage your account volume and lower costs.
      
      
      Drop filters evaluate logs for field:value exact matches. Incoming logs that match your account's active drop filters will not be indexed and will not appear in your Kibana account. Dropped logs are not searchable, cannot trigger alerts, and will not appear in dashboards, reports, or anything else.
      
      
      Drop filters do not affect archiving, as archiving happens earlier in the pipeline. Therefore, logs that are dropped using drop filters can be archived and restored in the event that they become relevant.
  - name: Manage shared tokens
    description: >-
      You can share Kibana visualization and dashboard snapshots using shared tokens.
      Token filters are available to help you control what data to expose.


      **Note:** Shared token endpoints require permissions that must be set by our Support team. Please email help@logz.io for assistance.
  - name: Logz.io snapshots
  - name: Manage users
  - name: Security events
    description: >-
      A security event is logged whenever a security rule triggers in your [Logz.io Cloud SIEM account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/rules/rule-definitions?from=0&sortBy=updatedAt&sortOrder=DESC).
      
      
      Your Logz.io Cloud SIEM is pre-loaded with hundreds of security rules created and maintained by Logz.io's security analysts. The list continues to be expanded and updated on a regular basis. You can also add your own security rules.


      To investigate into security events, you can begin by running a bulk query to fetch security event logs, either with or without applying filtering criteria. This query returns all of the events that match the query parameters and can potentially fetch events going back many months. Whenever you encounter a particular event you would like to further investigate, you can run the drilldown query to fetch the logs that triggered the security event to delve deeper into the event details.


      These queries can be used to integrate with an automated response solution such as Cortex xSOAR or simply to understand your security posture and identify suspicious activity in your accounts.
  - name: Archive logs
    description: >-
      You can archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage. Archiving gives you the option to restore logs and query them after they have expired from your time-based account.
      

      You can use the following endpoints to retrieve, set up, test, and update an account's archive settings.
      

      Note: Logs are archived before they are indexed and analyzed by Logz.io. Logs that are dropped by Logz.io's Drop filters will still be archived and available to be restored.

              By default, only this account is searched.


              A main account can search a sub account as long as it has the right permissions.
              To give search permissions to the main account,
              log in to the main account,
              go to the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page,
              and select **Searchable from the main account** for the intended sub account.


              To include multiple accounts, repeat this parameter for each account
              (for example: `accountIds=500&accountIds=600`).


              **Important**:
              If you include an account without the right permissions,
              the request will fail.


              If you include this parameter, the current account won't be searched
              unless you explicitly include it in the query.

                  #### Notes on the search time range

                  * By default, your query runs on data sent today and yesterday, UTC.
                    You can move this 2-calendar-day window by using the `dayOffset` query parameter.

                  * Searches without a `timestamp` filter will return 2 calendar days, UTC.
                    To search a different time frame, specify a filter on `timestamp`.

                example: { "bool": { "must": [{ "range": { "@timestamp": { "gte": "now-5m", "lte": "now" } } }] } }
              from:

      tags:
        - Search logs
      description: >-
        This endpoint can take 2 types of call requests. The first type runs a search query that returns a `scrollID` and the first batch of paginated results. The second request type passes only the `scroll_id` 
        (The variation in the field name is intentional) to fetch the next batches of paginated results.
        This endpoint always returns results as a stringified JSON.
        

        How it works:
        
        
        First, send a request to establish the `scrollID`. This initial request contains the query object and additional parameters, similar to the `v1/search` endpoint, with the exception that `dayOffset` and `accountIds` are not supported. The request will return the field `scrollId` and the number of `hits`, representing the number of matching results.
        
        
        Next, send the `scroll_id` in the request body to retrieve the log results as a stringified JSON. Each call returns the next page, where each page can return a maximum of 1000 results. Every time you resend the same `scroll_id` in the request body, it returns the next page until it reaches the end of the results. 
        You'll know you've reached the last page of results, once the call keeps returning the last page of results repeatedly. Keep sending the same scroll ID as many times as needed to retrieve all of the available results.
        The results are paginated, and the request advances through them, one at a time, by default. So that every time you send the request with the same `scroll_id`, the next batch of results is returned.
       

        **Note**:


        * Send the field `scroll_id` in requests (snake_case).
        
        * Receive the field `scrollID` in your responses (camelCase).

        Runs a search query in your Logz.io Cloud SIEM account to fetch the security events that match the query parameters.

        
        You have the option to filter by rule name, rule severity, and/or event timestamp, and sort the results by time and/or severity, but this is not required. If you send the query with an empty JSON body, it returns all of the events logged in your Logz.io Cloud SIEM, going as far back as your account's retention permits.

          * The query can only run on 2 consecutive indexes. By default, the query runs on data sent today and yesterday. You can also add a filter on `timestamp` to search a smaller time frame.

          * When using `query_string`, `allow_leading_wildcard` must be set to `false`

          * `wildcard` can't start with `*` or `?`
