##### Table view

At the bottom of the page, you can view your account's data as a table. The data is broken down by events, and you can view each event’s type, severity, number of grouped events, and the date on which the event was last triggered. 

When hovering over one of the events you'll see an **Investigate** button, which opens it in OpenSearch Dashboards, allowing you to drill down further into the issue.
