To simplify shipping if your Azure Blob logs,
we provide an automated deployment process.
This repo contains the code and instructions you'll need to ship logs from your Azure Blob Storage to Logz.io.
At the end of this process, your Azure function will forward logs from an Azure Blob Stroage Account to your Logz.io account.

## Setting log shipping from Azure
Option one: Build a new blob storage account and set your log shipping.

Option two: Set your log shipping for an existing blob storage.

# Option one:

## Build a new blob storage account and set your log shipping

### 1. Deploy the Logz.io template

 ðŸ‘‡Deploy your logs from an existing blob storage

 [![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Flogzio-azure-blob%2Fdevelop%2Fdeployments%2FdeploymentTemplateForNewStorage.json)

### 2. Configure the template

Make sure to use these settings:

**In the BASICS section**
* **Resource group**: Click **Create new**. <br />
  Give a meaningful **Name**, such as "logzioEventHubIntegration", and then click **OK**.
* **Location**: Choose the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Event Hub.

**In the SETTINGS section:**
* **Logs listener host**: Use the listener URL for your logs account region.
  If your login URL is app.logz.io, use `listener.logz.io` (this is the default setting).
  If your login URL is app-eu.logz.io, use `listener-eu.logz.io`.
* **Logs account token**: Use the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the logs account you want to ship to.

At the bottom of the page, select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, and then click **Purchase** to deploy.

Deployment can take a few minutes.

### 3. Check Logz.io for your logs

Upload blobs to your storage account and watch them in Kibana.

# Option two:

## Set your log shipping for an existing blob storage

*** This option is for storage account of kind "StorageV2" only.
 To find out your storage account's kind go to your Storage account/overview. ***
