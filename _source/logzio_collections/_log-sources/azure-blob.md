* [Connect to existing blob storage account](#existing-blob-config)
* [Create a new blob storage account](#new-blob-config)
{:.branching-tabs}

#### Which services are deployed 

The following services are created when you deploy this integration:

* Serveless Function App
* Application Insights
* App Service Plan
* Event Hubs Namspace

Make sure to use the settings shown below.

	
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group <span class="required-param"></span> | Click Create new. Give a meaningful Name, such as "logziobBlobStorageIntegration", and then click OK. |
| Location <span class="required-param"></span> | Select the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Blob Storage. |
| Logzio host <span class="required-param"></span>  | Use the listener URL specific to the region of your Logz.io account. You can look it up [here](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Log shipping token <span class="required-param"></span>  | Add the [log shipping token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) for the relevant Logz.io account. This is the account you want to ship to.  |
| Format <span class="default-param">`text`</span> | Select one of the supported parsing formats: text/json/csv |
| Buffersize <span class="default-param">`100`</span>  | The maximum number of messages the logger will accumulate before sending them all as a bulk  |
| Timeout <span class="default-param">`180,000 = 3 minutes`</span> | The read/write/connection timeout in *milliseconds*.  |
{:.paramlist}

At the bottom of the page, select **Review + Create**, and then click **Create** to deploy.  
Deployment can take a few minutes.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). 
Please note that only logs sent from this point on would be sent and appear under the type `blobStorage`.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
a blob storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** . If your existing blob storage account is of any other kind, it will NOT work. Instead, follow the process to set up a new blob storage account.

Double-check your [_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts) to make sure that they are compatible. They should be of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**.
