To simplify shipping if your Azure Blob logs,
we provide an automated deployment process.

At the end of this process,
your Azure function will forward logs from Azure Blob Storage
to your Logz.io account.

Make sure to use the settings shown below.

###### In the BASICS section

| Parameter | Description |

###### In the SETTINGS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Logs listener host | Use the listener URL for your logs account region. For more information on finding your account's region, see [Account region]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open Kibana.
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs with the type `blobStorage` in Kibana.

#### Set up shipping for an existing blob

This deployment works with General-purpose v2 storage accounts only.
These are listed as "StorageV2" in the
[_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts)
list,
under the _Kind_ column.
If you don't have a StorageV2 account,
don't continue with this procedure.
Instead, set up this deployment for an existing blob.
