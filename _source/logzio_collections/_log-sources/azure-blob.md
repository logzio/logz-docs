To simplify shipping of your logs in Azure Blob Storage,
we provide an automated deployment process.

At the end of this process,
this integration will forward logs from Azure Blob Storage
to your Logz.io account.

##### Configure an automated deployment

ðŸ‘‡ Click this button to start the automated deployment.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Flogzio-azure-blob%2Fmaster%2Fdeployments%2FdeploymentTemplateForNewStorage.json)

You'll be taken to Azure,
where you'll configure the resources to be deployed.
Make sure to use the settings shown below.

###### In the BASICS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group | Click **Create new**. Give a meaningful **Name**, such as "logziobBlobStorageIntegration", and then click **OK**. |
| Location | Choose the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Blob Storage. |
{:.paramlist}

###### In the SETTINGS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Logs listener host | Use the listener URL specific to the region of your Logz.io account. You can look it up [here]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Logs account token | Add the [log shipping token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) for the relevant Logz.io account. This is the account you want to ship to. |

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open Kibana.
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs with the type `blobStorage` in Kibana.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
