Logz.io provides an automated deployment process to simplify the process of shipping logs from Azure Blob Storage.
This integration forwards logs from your Azure Blob Storage
to your Logz.io account.

Make sure to use the settings shown below.

###### In the BASICS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Resource group | Click **Create new**. Give a meaningful **Name**, such as "logziobBlobStorageIntegration", and then click **OK**. |
| Location | Select the same region as the Azure services that will stream data to this Blob Storage. |
{:.paramlist}

###### In the SETTINGS section

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| Logs listener host | Use the listener URL specific to the region of your Logz.io account. You can look it up [here]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html). |
| Logs account token | Add the [log shipping token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) for the relevant Logz.io account. This is the account you want to ship to. |

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). 
Any logs sent from this point on should appear under the type `blobStorage`.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
a blob storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** . If your existing blob storage account is of any other kind, it will NOT work. Instead, follow the process to set up a new blob storage account.

Double-check your [_Storage accounts_](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Storage%2FStorageAccounts) to make sure that they are compatible. They should be of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)**.
