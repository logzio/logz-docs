{:.info-box.important}
<!-- info-box-end -->

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). You can filter for logs of `type` `blobStorage` to see the incoming logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
