Enable an Azure function to forward NSG logs from your Azure Blob Storage account to your Logz.io account.


**Before you begin, you'll need**:

<!-- info-box-end -->

###### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). You can filter for logs of `type` `blobStorage` to see the incoming logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
