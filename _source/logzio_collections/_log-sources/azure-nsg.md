Enable an Azure function to forward NSG logs from your Azure Blob Storage account to your Logz.io account.


**Before you begin, you'll need**: 

* An Azure Blob Storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** dedicated to NSG logs and called **Logzio_NSG_BLOB**
* A virtual machine instance in Azure resource group connected to the storage account
* Network Watcher enabled in the region of the virtual machine

<!-- info-box-end -->

###### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can filter for logs of `type` `azure_blob_trigger` to see the incoming logs.
  
If you still don’t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
