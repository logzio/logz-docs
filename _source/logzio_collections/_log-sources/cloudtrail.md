{% include log-shipping/s3-bucket.html service="CloudTrail" %}

#### Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` [permissions](https://support.logz.io/hc/en-us/articles/209486129-Troubleshooting-AWS-IAM-Configuration-for-retrieving-logs-from-a-S3-Bucket) for the required S3 bucket

* {% include log-shipping/s3-bucket-file-order.html %}

<div class="tasklist">

##### Send your logs to an S3 bucket

Logz.io fetches your CloudTrail logs from an S3 bucket.

For help with setting up a new trail, see [Overview for Creating a Trail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-create-and-update-a-trail.html) from AWS.

##### Add the S3 bucket information

{% include log-shipping/in-app-configuration.html toolId="s3-config" %}

<!-- logzio-inject:s3-config -->

When creating a bucket, you'll only need to fill in 2 parameters which you can get from your CloudTrail AWS path. The AWS path structure for CloudTrail looks like this:

{BUCKET_NAME}/{PREFIX_IF_EXISTS}/cloudtrail/AWSLogs/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/CloudTrail/

* {BUCKET_NAME} is your **S3 bucket name**.

* {PREFIX} is your CloudTrail path.

  If you don't have a prefix, put down `/cloudtrail/AWSLogs/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/CloudTrail/`.
  <br>
  If you have a prefix, put down `{PREFIX}/cloudtrail/AWSLogs/{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}/CloudTrail/`.

* {Region} is not needed. Logz.io will pull data from all regions in AWS for the specified bucket and account.


Logz.io fetches logs that are generated after configuring an S3 bucket.
Logz.io cannot fetch past logs retroactively.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
