## Setup

###### Configuration

{: .tasklist .firstline-headline }
1.  Create a new Lambda function

    This Lambda function will collect CloudWatch logs and sends them to Logz.io in bulk over HTTP.

    Open the AWS Lambda Console, and click **Create function**.
    Choose **Author from scratch**, and use this information:

    * **Name**: We suggest adding the log type to the name, but you can name this function whatever you want.
    * **Runtime**: Choose **Python 2.7**
    * **Role**: Click **Create new role from template(s)**. Under Existing role, select **Basic Edge Lambda permissions**

    Click **Create Function** (bottom right corner of the page). After a few moments, you'll see configuration options for your Lambda function.

    You'll need this page later on, so keep it open.

2.  Zip the source files

    Download the [CloudWatch Logs Shipper - Lambda](https://github.com/logzio/logzio_aws_serverless/tree/master/cloudwatch) project from GitHub to your computer, and zip the Python files in the src/ folder.

    ```shell
    mkdir dist; cp -r ../shipper dist/ && cp src/lambda_function.py dist/ && cd dist/ && zip logzio-cloudwatch shipper/* lambda_function.py
    ```

3.  Upload the zip file and set environment variables

    In the Function code section of Lambda find the **Code entry type** list. Choose **Upload a .ZIP file** from this list.

    Click **Upload**, and choose the zip file you created earlier (`logzio-cloudwatch.zip`).

    In the Environment variables section, set your Logz.io account token, URL, and log type, and any other variables that you need to use.

    TOKEN <span class="required-param"></span>
    : {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html token='noReplace' %}
      <!-- logzio-inject:account-token -->

    URL <span class="required-param"></span>
    : {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener='noReplace' %}
      <!-- logzio-inject:listener-url -->

    TYPE <span class="required-param"></span>
    : The log type you'll use with this Lambda.
      This can be a [built-in log type]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/built-in-log-types.html), or a custom log type. \\
      Please note that you should create a new Lambda for each log type you use.

    FORMAT <span class="default-param">`text`</span>
    : `json` or `text`.
      If `json`, the Lambda function will attempt to parse the message field as JSON and populate the event data with the parsed fields.

    COMPRESS <span class="default-param">`false`</span>
    : Set to `true` to compress logs before sending them. Set to `false` to send uncompressed logs.

4.  Configure the function's basic settings

    In Basic settings, we recommend starting with these settings:

    * **Memory**: 512 MB
    * **Timeout**: 1 min 0 sec

    <div class="info-box note">
    These default settings are just a starting point.
    Check your Lambda usage regularly, and adjust these values if you need to.
    </div>

5.  Set the CloudWatch Logs event trigger

    Find the **Add triggers** list (left side of the Designer panel). Choose **CloudWatch Logs** from this list.

    Below the Designer, you'll see the Configure triggers panel. Choose the **Log group** that the Lambda function will watch.

    Type a **Filter name** (required) and **Filter pattern** (optional).

    Click **Add**, and then click **Save** at the top of the page.

6.  Check Logz.io for your logs

    Give your logs a few minutes to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

    If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
