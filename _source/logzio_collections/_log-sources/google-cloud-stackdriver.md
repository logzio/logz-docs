## Setup

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Stackdriver collects logs and metrics from your cloud services.
You can use Google Cloud Pub/Sub to forward your logs from Stackdriver to Logz.io.

###### Configuration

**You'll need**:
[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts),
[a GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate),
[a GCP Pub/Sub topic and subscribers](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console) to your GCP project,
Google Stackdriver Logging configured for your project

<!-- TODO something's not right with this prereqs list. Google Stackdriver what? -->

1.  Export your logs to Pub/Sub

    Set up a sink to export your logs to Pub/Sub.

    For more information, see [Exporting with the Logs Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2) from Google Cloud.

2.  Build your credentials file

    Make a folder for the files you'll be working with.

    ```shell
    mkdir logzio-pubsub && cd logzio-pubsub
    ```

    Build your credentials file using your Google Cloud project ID.

    <!-- TODO replace /develop/ with /master/ -->

    ```shell
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/develop/Makefile \
    && make PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
    ```

    Run this command for each project you're working with.

3.  Build your Pub/Sub input YAML file

    Make `pubsub-input.yml`, which will hold your Pub/Sub input configuration.

    ```shell
    touch pubsub-input.yml
    ```

    Open `pubsub-input.yml` in your text editor, and paste this code block.

    Complete configuration instructions are below the code block. ðŸ‘‡

    <!-- TODO confirm the changes I made were okay
      - formatted `subscriptions` as an array
      - added relative path to credentials-file.json
      - question: is project the unique id in this array, or is the topic?
      - question: what does 'as given from Pub/Sub' mean?
    -->

    ```yaml
    logzio-pubsub:
        listener: <<LISTENER-HOST>>

        pubsubs:
        - project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
          credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
          token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
          topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
          subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
          type: stackdriver

        - project_id: PROJECT-2_ID
          credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
          token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
          topic_id: TOPIC-2_ID
          subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
          type: stackdriver

        - project_id: PROJECT-3_ID
          credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
          token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
          topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
          subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
          type: stackdriver
    ```

    Configuration instructions
    {:.inline-header}

    For extra guidance,
    please see the [sample configuration YAML](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/blob/develop/pubsub-input-example.yml).
    {:.info-box.note}

    listener
    : The Logz.io listener host. \\
      {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener=true %}

    pubsubs
    : This is an array of one or more GCP projects.
      For each project, provide topic and subscriptions IDs, as given from Pub/Sub.

    token
    : Your Logz.io shipping token.
      Include this with each project under `pubsubs`. \\
      {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html token=true %}

4.  Pull the Docker image

    Download the logzio/logzio-pubsub image:

    ```shell
    docker pull logzio/logzio-pubsub
    ```

5.  Run the container

    Run this command from `logzio-pubsub/`,
    where you stored `pubsub-input.yml`
    and `credentials-file.json`.

    ```shell
    docker run --name logzio-pubsub \
    -v ./pubsub-input.yml:/var/lib/filebeat/pubsub-input.yml \
    -v ./credentials-file.json:/var/lib/filebeat/credentials-file.json \
    logzio/logzio-pubsub
    ```

6.  Check Logz.io for your logs

    Spin up your Docker containers if you havenâ€™t done so already.

    Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours,
    and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).
