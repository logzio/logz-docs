#### Shipping Jenkins logs with Filebeat

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* [Filebeat 7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html) or [Filebeat 6](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.7/filebeat-installation.html)
* Root access
* Port 5015 open

<div class="tasklist">

{% include log-shipping/certificate.md %}

##### Add Jenkins as an input

In the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml), add Jenkins to the filebeat.inputs section.

{% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %}
Replace <<JENKINS-HOME>> with home location of your Jenkins installation

```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log
  paths:
  - /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
  - /var/<<JENKINS-HOME>>/jobs/*/builds/lastFailedBuild/log
  fields:
    logzio_codec: plain

    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: jenkins
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h
  multiline:
    pattern: '^[A-Z]{1}[a-z]{2} {1,2}[0-9]{1,2}, [0-9]{4} {1,2}[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}'
    negate: true
    match: after
```

If you're running Filebeat 7, paste this code block.
Otherwise, you can leave it out.

```yaml
# ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
processors:
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "agent"
      to: "filebeat_agent"
    ignore_missing: true
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "log.file.path"
      to: "source"
    ignore_missing: true
```

If you're running Filebeat 6, paste this code block.

```yaml
# ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
```

The above configuration assumes the following defaults:

* Log location - `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`
* Log type - `jenkins`

##### Set Logz.io as the output

If Logz.io is not an output, add it now.
Remove all other outputs.

{% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener=true %}

```yaml
# ...
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

##### Start Filebeat

Start or restart Filebeat for the changes to take effect.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana). You can search for `type:jenkins` to filter for your Jenkins logs. Your logs should be already parsed thanks to the Logz.io preconfigured parsing pipeline.

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
