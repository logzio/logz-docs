Lambda extensions enable tools to integrate deeply into the Lambda execution environment to control and participate in Lambda’s lifecycle.
To read more about Lambda Extensions, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html).  
The Logz.io Lambda extension for logs, uses the AWS Extensions API and [AWS Logs API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-logs-api.html), and sends your Lambda Function Logs directly to your Logz.io account.

This repo is based on the [AWS lambda extensions sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-extensions/tree/main/python-example-logs-api-extension/extensions).

### Prerequisites

* Lambda function with supported runtime for extensions (`python 3.7`, `python 3.8`).
* AWS Lambda limitations: A function can use up to five layers at a time. The total unzipped size of the function and all layers cannot exceed the unzipped deployment package size limit of 250 MB.

### Extension deployment options

You can deploy the extension via the AWS CLI or via the AWS Management Console.
  
#### Upgrading from v0.0.1 to v0.1.0
  
If you have extension v0.0.1, you need to upgrade to extension v0.1.0 to ensure that your logs are correctly sent to Logz.io.

To do this:
  
1. Delete existing extension layer, its dependencies and environment variables as decribed further in this document.
2. Deploy the new extension, its dependencies and configuration as decribed further in this document.

#### Deploying Logz.io logs extension via the AWS CLI

<div class="tasklist">

##### Deploy the extension, dependencies and configuration

If you haven't done it already, [install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) the AWS CLI.

Add the layer to your function and configure the environment variables using the following command:

```shell
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
    --function-name <<FUNCTION-NAME>> \
    --layers <<LAYERS>> \
    --environment "Variables={<<ENV-VARS>>}"
```

**Note:** this command overwrites the existing function configuration. If you already have your own layers and environment variables for your function, list them as well.

| Placeholder | Description | Required/Default|
|---|---|---|
| `<<FUNCTION-NAME>>` |  Name of the Lambda Function you want to monitor. |Required|
| `<<LAYERS>>` | A space-separated list of function layers to add to the function's execution environment. Specify each layer by its ARN, including the version.  For the ARN, see the [**Lambda extension versions** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}. You may need to add another layer that has the extensions dependencies.  For the libraries that your extension requires, see the [**Lambda extensions dependencies** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}. If your function doesn't already have those libraries under `/opt/python`, you'll need to add the dependencies as a layer, too.|  |
| `<<ENV-VARS>>`  | Key-value pairs containing environment variables that are accessible from function code during execution. Should appear in the following format: `KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string`.  For a list of all the environment variables for the extension, see the [**Lambda environment variables** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}.|  |

##### Run the function

Use the following command. It may take more than one run of the function for the logs to start shipping to your Logz.io account.

```shell
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
    --function-name <<FUNCTION-NAME>> \
    --layers [] \
    --environment "Variables={}"
```


<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This command overwrites the existing function configuration. If you already have your own layers and environment variables for your function, include them in the list.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->
  

#### Deleting the extension

To delete the extension, its dependencies and environment variables, use the following command:

```shell
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
    --function-name some-func \
    --layers [] \
    --environment "Variables={}"
```

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This command overwrites the existing function configuration. If you already have your own layers and environment variables for your function, include them in the list.

#### Deploying Logz.io log extensions via the AWS Management Console

You'll have to add the extension

<div class="tasklist">

##### Add the extension to your Lambda Function

1. In the Lambda Functions screen, choose the function you want to monitor.
![Pick lambda function](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/lambda_extensions/lambda-x_1-1.jpg)

2. In the page for the function, scroll down to the `Layers` section and choose `Add Layer`.
![Add layer](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/lambda_extensions/lambda-x_1-2.jpg)

3. Select the `Specify an ARN` option, then choose the ARN of the extension with the region code that matches your Lambda Function region from the [**Lambda extension versions** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}, and click the `Add` button.
![Add ARN extension](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/lambda_extensions/lambda-x_1-3.jpg)

4. *Optional*. This step adds the python libraries the extension needs to run. Refer to the [**ARN for extension dependencies** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}: If your Lambda function already has those libraries under `/opt/python`, you can skip this step. If not, you'll need it for the extension to run.

    a. Repeat step 2 to add another layer.
  
    b. Select the `Specify an ARN` option, then select the ARN that's compatible with the extension version you chose from the [**Dependencies** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}, and paste it in the textbox. 
  
    c. Click `Add`.

##### Configure the extension parameters

Add the environment variables to the function, according to the [**Environment variables** table]{% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink.md %} {% include log-shipping/lambda-xtension-tablink-indox.html %}.

##### Run the function

Run the function. It may take more than one run of the function for the logs to start shipping to your Logz.io account.


#### Deleting the extension

- To delete the **extension layer**: In your function page, go to the **layers** panel. Click `edit`, select the extension layer, and click `save`.
- To delete the **extension dependencies layer**: In your function page, go to the **layers** panel, click `edit`, select the extension dependencies layer, and click `save`.
- To delete the extension's **environment variables**: In your function page, select the `Configuration` tab, select `Environment variables`, click `edit`, and remove the variables that you added for the extension.
