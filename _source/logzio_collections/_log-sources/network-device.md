## Setup

###### Guided configuration

**You'll need**:
[Filebeat 7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html) or
[Filebeat 6](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.7/filebeat-installation.html),
root access

1.  Configure your device

    Configure your network device to send logs to your Filebeat server, TCP port 9000.
    See your device's documentation if you're not sure how to do this.

2.  Download the Logz.io certificate to your Filebeat server

    For HTTPS shipping, download the Logz.io public certificate to your certificate authority folder.

    ```shell
    sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/public-certificates/master/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt -P /etc/pki/tls/certs/
    ```

3.  Add TCP traffic as an input

    In the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml), add TCP to the filebeat.inputs section.

    {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html token=true %}

    ```yaml
    # ...
    filebeat.inputs:
    - type: tcp
      max_message_size: 10MiB
      host: "0.0.0.0:9000"

      fields:
        logzio_codec: plain

        # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
        #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
        token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
        type: network-device
      fields_under_root: true
      encoding: utf-8
      ignore_older: 3h
    ```

    If you're running Filebeat 7, paste this code block.
    Otherwise, you can leave it out.

    ```yaml
    # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
    filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
    processors:
    - rename:
        fields:
        - from: "agent"
          to: "filebeat_agent"
        ignore_missing: true
    - rename:
        fields:
        - from: "log.file.path"
          to: "source"
        ignore_missing: true
    ```

    If you're running Filebeat 6, paste this code block.

    ```yaml
    # ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
    registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
    ```

4.  Add Logz.io as an output

    If Logz.io is not an output, add it now.

    {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener=true %}

    ```yaml
    # ...
    output.logstash:
      hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
      ssl:
        certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
    ```

5.  Start Filebeat

    Start or restart Filebeat for the changes to take effect.

6.  Check Logz.io for your logs

    Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

    If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
