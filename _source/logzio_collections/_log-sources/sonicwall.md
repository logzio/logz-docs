#### Configuration

<div class="tasklist">

##### Before you begin

These are the prerequisites you'll need before you can begin:

* [SonicWall firewall](https://www.sonicwall.com/products/firewalls)
* [Filebeat 7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html)
* root access

##### Configure SonicWall Server logging

Configure your SonicWall firewall to send logs to your Filebeat server.
Make sure you meet this configuration:

* Log format: syslog
* Send over: UDP
* IP address: Filebeat server IP address
* Port 514

See [SonicWall docs](https://www.sonicwall.com/support/technical-documentation/?language=English) for more information
on configuring your SonicWall firewall.

##### Download the Logz.io public certificate to your Filebeat server

For HTTPS shipping, download the Logz.io public certificate to your certificate authority folder.

```shell
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/public-certificates/master/TrustExternalCARoot_and_USERTrustRSAAAACA.crt --create-dirs -o /etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt
```

##### Configure Filebeat

Open the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml) with your preferred text editor. Copy and paste the code block below, overwriting the previous contents.
(Replace the fileâ€™s contents with this code block.)

This code block adds SonicWall as an input sent over UDP traffic.

```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: udp
  max_message_size: 10MiB
  host: "0.0.0.0:514"

  fields:
    logzio_codec: plain

    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: sonicwall
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h

  # ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
processors:
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "agent"
      to: "filebeat_agent"
    ignore_missing: true
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "log.file.path"
      to: "source"
    ignore_missing: true
  ignore_older: 3h
```

Copy and paste the following code block directly below.
It sets Logz.io as the output.


```yaml
# ...
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

##### Replace the placeholders in the Filebeat configuration

Still in the same configuration file, replace the placeholders to match your specifics.

* {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html token=true %}

* {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener=true %}

One last validation - make sure Logz.io is the only output and appears only once.
If the file has other outputs, remove them.

##### Start Filebeat

Start or restart Filebeat for the changes to take effect.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
