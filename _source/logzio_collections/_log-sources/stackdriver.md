Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Stackdriver collects logs and metrics from your cloud services.
You can use Google Cloud Pub/Sub to forward your logs from Stackdriver to Logz.io.

#### Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts),
[a GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate),
[a GCP Pub/Sub topic and subscribers](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console) to your GCP project

<div class="tasklist">

##### Export your logs to Pub/Sub

Set up a sink to export your logs to Pub/Sub.

For more information, see [Exporting with the Logs Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2) from Google Cloud.

##### Build your credentials file

Build your credentials file using your Google Cloud project ID.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/master/Makefile \
&& make PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
```

Run this command for each project you're working with.

##### Build your Pub/Sub input YAML file

Make `pubsub-input.yml`, which will hold your Pub/Sub input configuration.

```shell
touch pubsub-input.yml
```

Open `pubsub-input.yml` in your text editor, and paste this code block.

Complete configuration instructions are below the code block. ðŸ‘‡

```yaml
logzio-pubsub:
    listener: <<LISTENER-HOST>>

    pubsubs:
    - project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
      topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
      token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
      credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
      subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
      type: stackdriver

    - project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
      topic_id: TOPIC-2_ID
      token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
      credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
      subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
      type: stackdriver

    - project_id: PROJECT-3_ID
      topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
      token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
      credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
      subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
      type: stackdriver
```


###### Configuration instructions

{:.paramlist}

##### Pull the Docker image

Download the logzio/logzio-pubsub image:

```shell
docker pull logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

##### Run the container

Run this command from `logzio-pubsub/`,
where you stored `pubsub-input.yml`
and `credentials-file.json`.

```shell
docker run --name logzio-pubsub \
-v $(pwd)/pubsub-input.yml:/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml \
-v $(pwd)/credentials-file.json:/logzio-pubsub/credentials-file.json \
logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Spin up your Docker containers if you havenâ€™t done so already.

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).
