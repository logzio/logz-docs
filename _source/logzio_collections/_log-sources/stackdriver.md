Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Stackdriver collects logs and metrics from your cloud services.
You can use Google Cloud Pub/Sub to forward your logs from Stackdriver to Logz.io.

#### Configuration

{% include trust-chain-warning.html msg='docker' %}

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
[Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts),
[a GCP project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate),
[a GCP Pub/Sub topic and subscribers](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console) to your GCP project

<div class="tasklist">

##### Export your logs to Stackdriver

Set up a sink to export your logs to Stackdriver.

For more information, see
[Exporting with the Logs Viewer](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2)
from Google Cloud.

##### Build your credentials file

Create a working directory for this step and `cd` into it.

```shell
mkdir logzio-stackdriver && cd logzio-stackdriver
```

You'll need to build a credentials file so Pub/Sub can authenticate
and get the right permissions.

This is simpler through the command line,
but if you don't have the right permissions,
you can use the Cloud Console.

###### Option 1: In the command line

Build your credentials file using your Google Cloud project ID.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-pubsub/master/Makefile \
&& make PROJECT_ID=<project_id>
```

Run this command for each project you're working with.

###### Option 2: In the Cloud Console

Go to your project's page in [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).
In the left menu, select **IAM & admin > Service accounts**.

At the top of the _Service accounts_ page, click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.

Give a descriptive **Service account name**, such as "credentials file".
Click **CREATE** to continue to the _Service account permissions_ page.

Add these roles:

* "Pub/Sub Editor"
* "Pub/Sub Publisher"
* "Pub/Sub Subscriber"

Click **CONTINUE** to continue to _Grant users access to this service account_.

Click **+ CREATE KEY** to open the _Create key_ panel.
Select **JSON** and click **CREATE** to save the private key to your machine.

Copy it to the `logzio-stackdriver/` folder you created
at the beginning of this step.

Click **DONE** to return to teh _Service accounts_ page.

##### Build your Pub/Sub input YAML file

Make `pubsub-input.yml`, which will hold your Pub/Sub input configuration.

```shell
touch pubsub-input.yml
```

Open `pubsub-input.yml` in your text editor, and paste this code block.

Complete configuration instructions are below the code block. ðŸ‘‡

```yaml
listener: <<LISTENER-HOST>>
pubsubs:
- project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
  topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
  token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
  credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
  subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
  type: stackdriver

- project_id: PROJECT-1_ID
  topic_id: TOPIC-2_ID
  token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
  credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
  subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
  type: stackdriver

- project_id: PROJECT-3_ID
  topic_id: TOPIC-1_ID
  token: <<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
  credentials_file: ./credentials-file.json
  subscriptions: ["SUB1_ID", "SUB2_ID", "SUB3_ID"]
  type: stackdriver
```


###### Configuration instructions

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| listener | The Logz.io listener host. <br> {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html listener=true %} |
| pubsubs | This is an array of one or more GCP subscriptions. For each subscription, provide topic and subscriptions IDs, as given from Pub/Sub. |
| token | Your Logz.io shipping token. Include this with each project under `pubsubs`. <br> {% include log-shipping/replace-vars.html token=true %} |
{:.paramlist}

##### Pull the Docker image

Download the logzio/logzio-pubsub image:

```shell
docker pull logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

##### Run the container

Run this command from `logzio-pubsub/`,
where you stored `pubsub-input.yml`
and `credentials-file.json`.

```shell
docker run --name logzio-pubsub \
-v $(pwd)/pubsub-input.yml:/logzio-pubsub/pubsub-input.yml \
-v $(pwd)/credentials-file.json:/logzio-pubsub/credentials-file.json \
logzio/logzio-pubsub
```

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Spin up your Docker containers if you havenâ€™t done so already.

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).
