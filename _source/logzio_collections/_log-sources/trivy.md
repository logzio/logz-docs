[Trivy](https://www.aquasec.com/products/trivy/) is an open-source vulnerability scanner for containers that can detect vulnerabilities in OS packages and application dependencies. The [Trivy Operator](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) is a Kubernetes operator that automates the process of scanning container images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

This integration utilizes the logzio-trivy Helm Chart to deploy:

* Trivy-Operator Helm Chart that scans the cluster and creates Trivy reports.
* A deployment that looks for the Trivy reports in the cluster, processes them, and sends them to Logz.io

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
At present, only vulnerability reports are being collected.

<!-- info-box-end -->

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This integration is presently in its beta phase and may be subject to modifications.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->


**Before you begin, you'll need**: 

* an active account with Logz.io
* Kubernetes cluster to send reports from

<div class="tasklist">


##### Add `logzio-helm` repo
  
```shell
helm repo add logzio-helm https://logzio.github.io/logzio-helm
helm repo update
```

###### Run the Helm deployment code

```shell
helm install -n monitoring --create-namespace \
--set env_id="<<ENV-ID>>" \
--set secrets.logzioShippingToken="<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>" \
--set secrets.logzioListener="<<LISTENER-HOST>>" \
logzio-trivy logzio-helm/logzio-trivy
```


<!-- info-box-start:info -->
With this command, we instruct Helm to create the monitoring namespace if it does not already exist.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `<<ENV-ID>>` | A unique name assigned to your environment's identifier, to differentiate telemetry data across various environments.
| `<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` | {% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %} |
| `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` | Replace `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` with the host for your region, without the `http/https` prefix. For example, `listener.logz.io` if your account is hosted on AWS US East, or `listener-nl.logz.io` if hosted on Azure West Europe.  |


##### Check Logz.io for your reports

Give your reports some time to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

####  Customizing Helm chart parameters


##### Configure customization options

You can use the following options to update the Helm chart parameters:

* Specify parameters using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`

* Edit the `values.yaml`

* Overide default values with your own `my_values.yaml` and apply it in the `helm install` command.

###### Custom parameters

| Parameter	| Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trivy-operator.trivy.ignoreUnfixed` | Determines whether to display only fixed vulnerabilities in the reports generated by Trivy. | `false` |
| `nameOverride` | Overrides the Chart name for resources. | `""` |
| `fullnameOverride` | Overrides the full name of the resources. | `""` |
| `schedule` | Time for daily scanning for security reports and sending them to Logz.io, in the "HH:MM" format. | `"07:00"` |
| `restartPolicy` | Container restart policy | `OnFailure` |
| `image` | Container image | `logzio/trivy-to-logzio` |
| `imageTag` | Container image tag | `0.1.0` |
| `env_id` | A unique name assigned to your environment's identifier, to differentiate telemetry data across various environments. | `""` |
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | Termination period (in seconds) to wait before killing Fluentd pod process on pod shutdown. | `30` |
| `serviceAccount.create` | Specifies whether to create a service account for the cron job. | `true` |
| `serviceAccount.name` | Name of the service account. | `""` |
| `secrets.enabled` | Specifies wheter to create a secret for the deployment | `true` |
| `secrets.name` | Secret name | `"logzio-logs-secret-trivy"` |
| `secrets.logzioShippingToken` | Your logz.io log shipping token | `""` |
| `secrets.logzioListener` | Your logz.io listener host | `""` (defaults to us region) |
| `scriptLogLevel` | Log level of the script that sends security risk to Logz.io. Can be one of: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. | `INFO` |


#### Uninstalling the Chart

The Uninstall command is used to remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and to delete the release.  

To uninstall the `logzio-trivy` deployment, use the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall logzio-trivy
```

#### Handling image pull rate limit

In certain cases, such as spot clusters, where pods or nodes are frequently replaced, the pull rate limit for images retrieved from Docker Hub may be reached, resulting in an error:

```
You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits.
```

In these cases we can use the following `--set` command to use an alternative image repository:

```shell
--set image=public.ecr.aws/logzio/trivy-to-logzio
```
