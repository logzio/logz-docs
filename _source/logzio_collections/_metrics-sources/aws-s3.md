To simplify shipping metrics from one or many sources,
we created Docker Metrics Collector.
Docker Metrics Collector is a container
that runs Metricbeat with the modules you enable at runtime.

{% include /metric-shipping/docker-metricbeat-version.md %}

#### Configuration

If you're not already running Docker Metrics Collector,
follow these steps.

Otherwise, stop the container, add
`aws`
to the `LOGZIO_MODULES` environment variable, and restart.
You can find the `run` command and all parameters
in this procedure.

##### Set up your IAM user

You'll need an [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
with these permissions:
`cloudwatch:GetMetricData`,
`cloudwatch:ListMetrics`,
`ec2:DescribeRegions`,
`iam:ListAccountAliases`,
`sts:GetCallerIdentity`

If you don't have one, set that up now.

Create an **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** for the IAM user,
and paste them in your text editor.

You'll need these for your Metricbeat configuration later.

##### Get your metrics region

You'll need to specify the AWS region you're collecting metrics from.

![AWS region menu](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/aws/region-menu.png)

Find your region's slug in the region menu
(in the top menu, on the right side).

For example:
The slug for US East (N. Virginia)
is "us-east-1",
and the slug for Canada (Central) is "ca-central-1".

Paste your region slug in your text editor.
You'll need this for your Metricbeat configuration later.

##### _(Optional)_ Enable S3 request metrics

The Metricbeat configuration
you'll set up later
collects S3 request metrics.
These metrics aren't enabled by default.

This is a per-bucket setting.
If you're not sure how to enable request metrics, see
[How Do I Configure Request Metrics for an S3 Bucket?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/configure-metrics.html)
from AWS.

##### Pull the Docker image

Download the Docker Metrics Collector image:

```shell
docker pull logzio/docker-collector-metrics
```
