<div id="variables">

This integration allows you to run a Cloudwatch exporter as a Docker container with environment variables to send Cloudwatch metrics to your Logz.io account.  We recommend using this configuration as default.

We simplify the data export and collection of your metrics. You tell us the desired namespaces and regions that you want to send your data from and we fetch the most relevant metrics to display in the Logz.io pre-built infrastructure monitoring dashboards.

### Important notes

* Extra calls and charges on AWS API requests may be generated by this project.

* You can track the number of AWS API requests with the `cloudwatch_requests_total` metric, which provides labels with the API name and namespace specification. For example, `cloudwatch_requests_total{action="getMetricStatistics",namespace="AWS/EC2",} 876.0`.

* For more information about the prom/cloudwatch-exporter cost, refer to the relevant [Prometheus documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#cost) and to the [AWS cloudwatch API pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

##### Set up your IAM user

You'll need an [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
with the following permissions:

* `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
* `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
* `tag:GetResources`

If you don't have one, set that up now.

Create an **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** for the IAM user,
and paste them in your text editor.

##### Get your metrics region

You'll need to specify the AWS region you're collecting metrics from.

![AWS region menu](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/aws/region-menu.png)

Find your region's slug in the region menu
(in the top menu, on the right side).

For example:
The slug for US East (N. Virginia)
is "us-east-1", and the slug for Canada (Central) is "ca-central-1".

##### Run the container with environment variables
  
```shell
docker run --name cloudwatch-metrics \
-e TOKEN=<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
-e LOGZIO_REGION=<<LOGZIO_REGION>> \
-e AWS_REGION=<<AWS_REGION>> \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>> \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>> \
-e AWS_NAMESPACES=<<AWS_NAMESPACES>> \
logzio/cloudwatch-metrics
```

| Environment variable | Description |
|---|---|
| AWS_REGION (Required) | Your region's slug. You can find this in the AWS Console region menu (in the top menu, to the right).  **Note:** This is the region that you will collect metrics from. |
| LOGZIO_REGION (Required)| Your Logz.io region code. For example if your region is US, then your region code is `us`. You can find your region code here: https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#regions-and-urls. |
| `<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` (Required)| Token for shipping metrics to your Logz.io account. Find it under Settings > Manage accounts. [_How do I look up my Metrics account token?_](/user-guide/accounts/finding-your-metrics-account-token/) |
| AWS_NAMESPACES (Required) | Comma-separated list of namespaces of the metrics you want to collect. You can find a complete list of namespaces at [_AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html).   **Note:** This Environment variable is required unless you define the `CUSTOM_CONFIG` Environment variable |
| SCRAPE_INTERVAL | The time interval (in seconds) during which the Cloudwatch exporter retrieves metrics from Cloudwatch, and the Opentelemtry collector scrapes and sends the metrics to Logz.io. Default = `300`.   **Note:** This value must be a multiple of 60.|
| P8S_LOGZIO_NAME | The value of the `p8s_logzio_name` external label. This variable identifies which Prometheus environment the metrics arriving at Logz.io came from. Default = `logzio-cloudwatch-metrics`.  |
| CUSTOM_CONFIG | Mount your cloudwatch exporter configuration file `-v pathToConfig/config.yml:config_files/cloudwatch.yml` and set to `true` if you want to use custom configuration for cloudwatch exporter, Default = `false` |
| CUSTOM_LISTENER | Set a custom URL to ship metrics to (for example, http://localhost:9200). This overrides the `LOGZIO_REGION` Environment variable. |
| SCRAPE_TIMEOUT | The time to wait before throttling a scrape request to cloudwatch exporter, Default = `120`|
| REMOTE_TIMEOUT | the time to wait before throttling remote write post request to logz.io, Default = `120`|

| LOGZIO_LOG_LEVEL | `builder.py` Python script log level. Default = `info` |
| AWS_ROLE_ARN | Your IAM role to assume. |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Your IAM user's access key ID. |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Your IAM user's secret key. |
| SET_TIMESTAMP | Boolean for whether to set the Prometheus metric timestamp as the original Cloudwatch timestamp. Default = `false` |
| PERIOD_SECONDS | period to request the metric for. Only the most recent data point is used. Default = `300` |
| RANGE_SECONDS | how far back to request data for. Useful for cases such as Billing metrics that are only set every few hours. Default = `300` |
| DELAY_SECONDS | The newest data to request. Used to avoid collecting data that has not fully converged. Default = `300` |

##### Publish extension ports (optional)
  
You can monitor the container using opentelemetry extensions in the following ports:
  
* 8888 - `opentelemetry metrics`
* 55679 - `Zpages`
* 13133 - `Health check`
* 1777 - `Pprof`
  
You can also publish the ports to your host network by using the `-p` flag:
  
```shell
docker run --name cloudwatch-metrics \
-v <<path_to_config_file>>:config_files/config.yml \
-p 8888:8888 \
-p 55679:55679 \
-p 13133:13133 \
-p 1777:1777 \
logzio/cloudwatch-metrics

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours.
