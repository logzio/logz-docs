This project allows you to collect Prometheus-format metrics from Amazon CloudWatch with the CloudWatch exporter, and ship them to Logz.io using the OpenTelemetry collector.

We simplify the data export and collection for your metrics: You tell us the desired namespaces and regions you want to send your data from and we fetch the most relevant metrics to display in the Logz.io pre-built Infrastructure Monitoring dashboards.
