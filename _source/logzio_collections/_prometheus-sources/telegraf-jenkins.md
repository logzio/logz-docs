## Overview

Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Jenkins metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.jenkins** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configuring Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

<div class="tasklist">

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{% include metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md %}
 
##### Add the inputs.jenkins plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Jenkins data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.jenkins]]
   ## The Jenkins URL in the format "schema://host:port"
  url = "http://my-jenkins-instance:8080"
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "admin"

  ## Set response_timeout
  response_timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use SSL but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false

  ## Optional Max Job Build Age filter
  ## Default 1 hour, ignore builds older than max_build_age
  # max_build_age = "1h"

  ## Optional Sub Job Depth filter
  ## Jenkins can have unlimited layer of sub jobs
  ## This config will limit the layers of pulling, default value 0 means
  ## unlimited pulling until no more sub jobs
  # max_subjob_depth = 0

  ## Optional Sub Job Per Layer
  ## In workflow-multibranch-plugin, each branch will be created as a sub job.
  ## This config will limit to call only the lasted branches in each layer,
  ## empty will use default value 10
  # max_subjob_per_layer = 10

  ## Jobs to include or exclude from gathering
  ## When using both lists, job_exclude has priority.
  ## Wildcards are supported: [ "jobA/*", "jobB/subjob1/*"]
  # job_include = [ "*" ]
  # job_exclude = [ ]

  ## Nodes to exclude from gathering
  # node_exclude = [ ]

  ## Worker pool for jenkins plugin only
  ## Empty this field will use default value 5
  # max_connections = 5
```

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
The database name is only required for instantiating a connection with the server and does not restrict the databases that we collect metrics from. The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/jenkins/README.md).

<!-- info-box-end -->

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{% include metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md %}
{% include general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html %}

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
