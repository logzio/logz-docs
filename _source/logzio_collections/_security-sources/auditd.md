As its name suggests, auditd is a service that audits activities in a Linux environment.
It's available for most major Linux distributions.

This page gives instructions for replacing auditd with Auditbeat
so you can easily ship your audit logs to Logz.io.

#### Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
auditd,
root access

<div class="tasklist">

{% include log-shipping/certificate.md %}

##### Install Auditbeat

Download and install [Auditbeat 7.7](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/7.7/auditbeat-installation.html).

##### Copy auditd rules

Go to the audit rules location in you auditbeat directory. The default location:

```js
cd /etc/auditbeat/audit.rules.d/
```

Rename the file `sample-rules.conf.disabled` to `audit-rules.conf`. It will hold your audit rules for Auditbeat:

```shell
cp sample-rules.conf.disabled audit-rules.conf
```

You need root privileges to interact with the auditd rules file.

##### Add auditd as a source input and Logz.io as an output

Open the Auditbeat configuration file (`/etc/auditbeat/auditbeat.yml`). Here's how to do it using CLI.

Go back to the Auditbeat directory:

  ```shell
  cd /etc/auditbeat
  ```

Wipe the file auditbeat.yml clean. In other words, delete its contents.

  ```shell
  su
  echo "" > auditbeat.yml
  exit
  ```

Copy and paste the following yml configuration to the auditbeat.yml file:

```shell
# ...
fields:
  type: auditd
  logzio_codec: json
  token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
fields_under_root: true
processors:
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "agent"
      to: "beat_agent"
    ignore_missing: true
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "log.file.path"
      to: "source_auditd"
    ignore_missing: true
#==========================  Modules configuration =============================

    ## Create file watches (-w) or syscall audits (-a or -A). Uncomment these
    ## examples or add your own rules.
    ## If you are on a 64 bit platform, everything should be running
    ## in 64 bit mode. This rule will detect any use of the 32 bit syscalls
    ## because this might be a sign of someone exploiting a hole in the 32
    ## bit API.

##### Replace the placeholders in the configuration

Still in the same configuration file, replace the placeholders to match your specifics.

{% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token-bullet.html %}

* {% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %} 


##### Start Auditbeat

Stop auditd, and then start Auditbeat.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
