### Ship events data from your Auth0 account to Logz.io

Auth0 is an easy to implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform. Deploy this integration to ship Auth0 events from your Auth0 account to Logz.io using custom log stream via webhooks.

**Before you begin, you'll need**: an active account with Auth0

<div class="tasklist">

#### Setup a custom log stream using webhooks

##### Create a custom log stream

1. Log in to your Auth0 account, navigate to **Auth0 Dashboard > Monitoring > Streams**, and select **Create Stream**.
  
2. On the **New Event Stream**, select **Custom Webhook**.

   The following screen appears:
   ![Create stream](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/auth0/Auth0-logzio-integration.png)
  
3. In the **Name** field, enter **Logz.io integration** and select **Create**.


##### Configure the required parameters
  
The **Settings** tab of the created event stream is displayed after you create the stream.

Configure the required parameters as follows:

![Configure stream](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/auth0/webhook-auth0.png)

   * In the **Name** field, enter **Logz.io integration**.
   * In the **Payload URL** field, enter `https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071/?token=<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>&type=auth0`. {% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %}  {% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %}
   * In the **Content Type** field, select **application/json**.
   * In the **Content Format** field, select **JSON lines**.

##### Save the changes

Select **Save** to save the changes and create the stream.

#### Check Logz.io for your data

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can filter for data of type `auth0` to see the incoming Auth0 events. 

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
