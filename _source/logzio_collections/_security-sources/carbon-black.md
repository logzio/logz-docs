Follow the [guidelines provided by VMware Carbon Black](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/platform/integrations/) to forward logs to an S3 bucket.

##### Configure Logz.io to read VMware Carbon Black logs from an S3 Bucket

**Required permissions**:

* A user with permissions to list the buckets on the relevant S3 Bucket.
* Permission to **Get** from all the paths under the bucket name.
* If you run into issues, please reference our guide for [troubleshooting S3 user permissions](https://support.logz.io/hc/en-us/articles/209486129-Troubleshooting-AWS-IAM-Configuration-for-retrieving-logs-from-a-S3-Bucket).

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana) and search for `type: carbon_black`.

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
