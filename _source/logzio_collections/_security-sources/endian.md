##### Configure Filebeat

1. Paste the following into the inputs section of the Filebeat configuration file:

   ```yaml
   filebeat.inputs:
   #protocol needs to be the same as the Endian log settings,
   - type: tcp
     max_message_size: 10MiB
     host: "0.0.0.0:9000"
     fields:
       logzio_codec: plain
       token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
       type: endianfw
     fields_under_root: true
     encoding: utf-8
     ignore_older: 3h
   
   #For version 6.x and lower
   #filebeat.registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
   
   #For version 7 and higher
   filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
   
   #The following processors are to ensure compatibility with version 7
   processors:
   - rename:
       fields:
        - from: "agent"
          to: "beat_agent"
       ignore_missing: true
   - rename:
       fields:
        - from: "log.file.path"
          to: "source"
       ignore_missing: true
   
   ############################# Output ##########################################
   
   output:
     logstash:
       hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
       ssl:
         certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
           
   ```
  
   * {% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.md %}
   * {% include log-shipping/listener-var.md %}

2. Run Filebeat with the new configuration.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana/discover?). You can filter for data of type `endianfw` to see the incoming Endian Firewall logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your data, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
