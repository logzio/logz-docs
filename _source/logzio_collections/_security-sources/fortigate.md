FortiGate units are installed as a gateway or router between two networks. This integration allows you to send FortiGate logs to your Logz.io SIEM account.

#### Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html) installed
* Root access

<div class="tasklist">

##### Configure FortiGate logging

Configure your FortiGate firewall to send logs to your Filebeat server.
Make sure you meet this configuration:

* Log format: syslog
* Send over: UDP
* IP address: Filebeat server IP address
* Port 514

See the [FortiGate docs](https://docs.fortinet.com/product/fortigate/) for more information
on configuring your FortiGate firewall.

###### Sample commands for FortiOS 6.2

```
config log syslogd setting
set status enable
set format default
set server <FILEBEAT-SERVER-IP-ADDR>
set port 514
end
```

{% include log-shipping/certificate.md %}

##### Add UDP traffic as an input

In the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml), add UDP to the filebeat.inputs section.

{% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %}

{% include log-shipping/filebeat-input-extension.md %}


```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: udp
  max_message_size: 10MiB
  host: "0.0.0.0:514"

  fields:
    logzio_codec: plain

    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: fortigate
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h
```

If you're running Filebeat 7, paste this code block.
Otherwise, you can leave it out.

```yaml
# ... For Filebeat 7 only ...
filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat
processors:
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "agent"
      to: "filebeat_agent"
    ignore_missing: true
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "log.file.path"
      to: "source"
    ignore_missing: true
```

If you're running Filebeat 6, paste this code block.

```yaml
# ... For Filebeat 6 only ...
registry_file: /var/lib/filebeat/registry
```

##### Set Logz.io as the output

If Logz.io is not an output, add it now.
Remove all other outputs.

{% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %} 

```yaml
# ...
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

##### Start Filebeat

[Start or restart Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/filebeat-starting.html) for the changes to take effect.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [Filebeat troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/log-sources/filebeat.html#troubleshooting).
