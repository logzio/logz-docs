Google Workspace is a collection of cloud computing, productivity and collaboration tools, software and products developed and marketed by Google. You can ship Google Workspace logs to Logz.io using Filebeat and Google Reports API.


**Before you begin, you'll need**: [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html) installed.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
The GSuite module was [deprecated as of Filebeat 7.12](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-gsuite.html#filebeat-module-gsuite) and has been replaced with the [Google Workspace module](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html), to align with Google's current naming. The integration remains the same, requiring only that you replace "- module: gsuite" with "- module: google_workspace" in the modules block.

#### Google Workspace setup

##### Set up a Service Account


Follow the official Google Workspace [tutorial](https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/10839762?sjid=10874551070185788155-EU#zippy=%2Cstep-use-google-cloud-to-turn-on-apis) for setting up a service account through IAM.

##### Grant access to the Admin SDK API

Enable access to the following APIs and services. If you can't find the API, specify the API name in **APIs & Services > Library** search box.

* Admin SDK
* People API (If you're using a Google Workspace Migrate version earlier than 2.4.2.0, use the Contacts API instead.)
* Google Workspace Migrate API
* Gmail API
* Google Calendar API
* Google Drive API
* Groups Migration API
* Groups Settings API
* Google Sheets API
* Tasks API

##### Delegate domain-wide authority to your service account

Open your Google Workspace domain’s [Admin console](http://admin.google.com/). Next, navigate to **Main menu** > **Security** > **API controls**.

In the Domain-wide delegation pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**. 


If you **can't** find the Manage Domain Wide Delegation option, you will need to **switch to a super-admin** Google Workspace account.
{:.info-box.note}

Once you access the **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**, click **Add new**, and fill in the details:

* **Client ID** - Enter the service account's Client ID - you can find it in the service account's details under **Unique ID**. It is also found in the **client_id** field of the credentials file that was auto-downloaded when you created a new key for your service account.
* **OAuth Scopes** - Enter [the admin's API](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly)
* Click **Authorize** to confirm your changes.

#### Filebeat monitoring setup

{% include log-shipping/certificate.md %}

##### Configure Filebeat

Open the Filebeat configuration file (the default path `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`) with your preferred text editor.
Copy and paste the code block below, overwriting the previous contents.

{% include log-shipping/filebeat-input-extension.md %}


```yaml
### Filebeat


### General

    var.delegated_account: "<<DELEGATED_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>>"

### Input

### Registry
filebeat.registry.path: /var/lib/filebeat

### Processors
# The following processors are to ensure compatibility with version 7
processors:
- if:
    has_fields: ['gsuite']
  then:
  - rename:
      fields:
      - from: "source"
        to: "gsuite_source"
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "agent"
      to: "filebeat_agent"
    ignore_missing: true
- rename:
    fields:
    - from: "log.file.path"
      to: "source"
    ignore_missing: true
- add_id: ~

### Output 
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"] 
  # Replace <<LISTENER-HOST>> with the host for your region. For example, listener.logz.io if your account is hosted on AWS US East, or listener-nl.logz.io if hosted on Azure West Europe. The required port depends whether HTTP or HTTPS is used: HTTP = 8070, HTTPS = 8071.


  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

For a full list of available Filebeat configuration options for the Google Workspace module, please see Filebeat's [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-module-google_workspace.html).



Still in the same configuration file, replace the placeholders to match your specifics.

{% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %}

{% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %} 

* Replace `<<PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_FILE>>` with the path to the file (for example `./credentials_file.json` with credentials of the service account path that was created on the GCP. It is preferable to use the full path for the file.

* Replace `<<DELEGATED_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>>` with the email address of the Admin (in most cases **superadmin**) that authorized the domain wide delegation function to the service account (GCP) on the **Google Workspace account**.

##### Start Filebeat

[Start or restart Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/filebeat-starting.html) for the changes to take effect.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [Filebeat troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/log-sources/filebeat.html#troubleshooting).
