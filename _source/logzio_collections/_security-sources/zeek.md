Zeek is a free and open-source software network analysis framework. This integration allows you to send Zeek logs to your Logz.io SIEM account.

#### Guided configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* Zeek or Bro
* [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html)
* Root access

<div class="tasklist">

##### Configure Zeek to output JSON logs

The configuration filepath changes
depending on your version of Zeek or Bro.
For this reason, see your installation's [documentation](https://www.zeek.org/documentation/)
if you need help finding the file.

If you're running Bro (Zeek's predecessor),
the configuration filename will be `ascii.bro`.
Otherwise, the filename is `ascii.zeek`.

In the configuration file,
find the line that begins `const use_json`.
Set the value to `T` (true):

```
const use_json = T &redef;
```

{% include log-shipping/certificate.md %}

##### Add Zeek as an input

In the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml), add Zeek to the filebeat.inputs section.

{% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html %}

{% include log-shipping/filebeat-input-extension.md %}


```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: filestream

  # The path to your logs can change depending on your version and configuration.
  # To find it, run zeekctl config
  # sudo ./zeekctl config | grep logdir
  paths:
  - /var/log/bro/current/conn.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/ssh.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/rdp.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/ssl.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/smb.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/dpd.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/dns.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/http.log

  fields:
    logzio_codec: json

    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: zeek
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h

- type: filestream
  paths:
    - /var/log/bro/current/notice.log
  fields:
    logzio_codec: json
    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: zeek_alert
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h
```

If you're running Filebeat 7 to 8.1, paste the code block below instead:

```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: log

  # The path to your logs can change depending on your version and configuration.
  # To find it, run zeekctl config
  # sudo ./zeekctl config | grep logdir
  paths:
  - /var/log/bro/current/conn.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/ssh.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/rdp.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/ssl.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/smb.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/dpd.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/dns.log
  - /var/log/bro/current/http.log

  fields:
    logzio_codec: json

    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: zeek
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h

- type: log
  paths:
    - /var/log/bro/current/notice.log
  fields:
    logzio_codec: json
    # Your Logz.io account token. You can find your token at
    #  https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: zeek_alert
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h
```


##### Set Logz.io as the output

If Logz.io is not an output, add it now.
Remove all other outputs.

{% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %} 

```yaml
# ...
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

##### Start Filebeat

[Start or restart Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/filebeat-starting.html) for the changes to take effect.

##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [Filebeat troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/log-sources/filebeat.html#troubleshooting).
