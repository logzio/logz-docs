### Overview

Deploy this integration to collect metrics of ping statistics collected from your preferred web addresses and send them to Logz.io.

The integration is based on a Lambda function that will be auto-deployed together with the layer [LogzioLambdaExtensionLogs](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-lambda-extensions/tree/main/logzio-lambda-extensions-logs).

Keep the defaults and click **Next**.

##### Review the deployment

Confirm that you acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources and select **Create stack**.


##### Run the tests

Run the ping statistics tests to generate metrics.


##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana). All metrics that were sent from the Lambda function will have the prefix `ping_stats` in their name.
