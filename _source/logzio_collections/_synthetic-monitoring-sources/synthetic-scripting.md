### Overview

This mini application for synthetic scripting mimics and supervises your personalized user experience through browser scripting, which directs the browser to your website, performs specific actions, and verifies specific elements. By utilizing synthetic frameworks like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), the synthetic scripting app facilitates the creation of tests to specify your custom user experience.


<div class="tasklist">

##### Run Application

1. Pull the Docker image.

```sh
docker pull logzio/synthetic-script:latest
```

2. Run the Docker container.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d --name synthetic-script logzio/synthetic-script:latest
```

The Docker image will run a Node.js mini app. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser to access the UI that helps you establish connection between your app and Logz.io.

##### Define a script for running the test

![UI first screen](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/synthetic_scripting/screen-edit.png)

1. Select the required framework for your test code from the **Framework selector** dropdown.
   ![UI dropdown](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/synthetic_scripting/dropdown-framework.png)

2. Enter your code into the Code editor.
   ![UI code editor](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/synthetic_scripting/code-editor.png)

Here you can define the code for your test using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Put your code between the comments.

Click the **Test Script** button to check if the code runs correctly.

3. Check if you want to record browser based video of your test.
   ![UI record-video](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/synthetic_scripting/record-video.png)

4. You can select device on what you want to start a test.

5. Define environment variables in the Environment Variables manager.
   ![UI env-variable](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/synthetic_scripting/env-variable.png)

In the **Environment Variable** manager you can define environment variables that can be attached to your Lambda function. You can use them in the Code editor as `process.env.KEY` and define the `KEY` parameter, which will be present in the Lambda function.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
Prior to testing the code locally, fill in the KEY-VALUE fields for all environment variables used.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->


6. Download the code as a template or deploy it directly to your cloud provider, using the `Explore/deploy` tab.

##### Download as a template

Open the tab to download the code as a template and fill in the parameters as per the parameters table.

##### Deploy directly to the cloud

Open the tab to deploy the code directly to the cloud and fill in the parameters as per the parameters table.

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics a few minutes to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics).
