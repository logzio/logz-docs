# How to use technical notes

**IMPORTANT**:
This readme file is not published with the rest of the site.
**Do not change the filename.**


## Adding a new technical note

1. In <https://github.com/logzio/logz-docs/tree/develop/_source/logzio_collections/_technical-notes>,
  click **Create new file**.

2. Give the file a name (and `.md` extension) and add frontmatter.
   Start on line 1, and leave a blank line after the frontmatter.

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Your clear, straightforward title (sentence case)
   ---
   ```

3. Add your content using markdown. Notes on our flavor of markdown (kramdown):

    * A single line break converts to a single HTML space (`&nbsp;`).
      To start a new paragraph, use two line breaks.
    * Basic styling:
      ```md
      ## Heading 2
      ### Heading 3
      **bold**
      _italic_
      [link text](https://some-website.com)
      ![image alt text](https://image-url.com)
      * bulleted list
      1. numbered list
      ```
    * Use H2 (`##`) H3 (`###`) only.
      H1 is reserved for page title;
      H4 through H6 are reserved for task lists.
      Leave a blank line before and after each heading.

4. When you're done, find the **Commit new file** section below the edit box.
  Add a commit message.
  Good practice is to write in present tense and keep it to 50 characters or fewer.
  (For example: `write technical note on kibana upgrade`)

5. Click **Create a new branch...**, and then click **Commit new file**.
  This starts a pull request that the docs manager will review.

If you need to deploy urgently, tell the docs manager.
