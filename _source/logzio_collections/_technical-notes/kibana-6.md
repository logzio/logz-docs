updated: 2019-01-16

Logz.io has upgraded your account to Kibana 6.3, and we want to ensure that you are enabled to take advantage of the new and enriched features that will be available to you so that you and your teams can plan accordingly.

You’ll immediately notice some UI changes in Kibana which will be reviewed here, but the most impactful change will likely be the upcoming improvement of the search experience with the addition of autocomplete and Kuery.

## UI Upgrades

The main UI changes being made available include new colors for better contrast, and improved screen reading and keyboard navigation. Dashboarding also has a new “Full-Screen Mode” was added when viewing dashboards that allow users to enjoy all the Kibana goodness in full-screen mode. 

## Autocomplete Search (Coming soon!)

Logz.io will be introducing autocomplete and the option for to use Kuery, a functional querying syntax introduced in Kibana 6.0. In future versions, Kibana will be moving away from Kuery, in favor of a simpler search syntax based on the tried-and-true Lucene syntax. The focus has shifted to making searches easier, and you can read up on how to use this syntax [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.3/kuery-query.html).

The search experience is made even easier, though, with autocomplete. When beginning a search in Kibana, we will provide suggestions for fields, values and query operators, based on the data you are searching (the Elasticsearch index you are querying).

## We’ve Got You Covered

You may have heard or read about various breaking changes when migrating existing Kibana installations, including the need to re-index your Kibana Index. With Logz.io we’ve taken care of all of these details for you as part of our managed upgrade process, so you can continue to work worry-free and simply enjoy the new features as they come.

Any of your existing dashboards will move over with the upgrade, so you should not expect any disruptions. If you do notice any problems please reach out to your customer success engineer or solutions architect.
