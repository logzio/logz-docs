Deploy this integration to enable automatic instrumentation of your .NET application using OpenTelemetry.

### Architecture overview

This integration includes:

* Installing the OpenTelemetry .NET instrumentation packages on your application host
* Installing the OpenTelemetry collector with Logz.io exporter
* Running your .NET application in conjunction with the OpenTelemetry instrumentation

On deployment, the .NET instrumentation automatically captures spans from your application and forwards them to the collector, which exports the data to your Logz.io account.

### Setup auto-instrumentation for your locally hosted ASP.NET Core application and send traces to Logz.io

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* An ASP.NET Core application without instrumentation
* An active account with Logz.io
* Port `4317` available on your host system
* A name defined for your tracing service


<div class="tasklist">


##### Download instrumentation packages

Run the following command from the application directory:

```shell
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore
dotnet add package OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting
```

##### Enable instrumentation in the code

Add the following configuration to the beginning of the Startup.cs file:

```cs
using OpenTelemetry.Resources;
using OpenTelemetry.Trace;
```

Add the following configuration to the Startup class:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {

            AppContext.SetSwitch("System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler.Http2UnencryptedSupport", true);

            services.AddOpenTelemetryTracing((builder) => builder
                .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation()
                .SetResourceBuilder(ResourceBuilder.CreateDefault().AddService("my-app"))
                .AddOtlpExporter(options =>
                {
                    options.Endpoint = new Uri("http://localhost:55681");
             
                })
            );
        }
```


##### Download and configure OpenTelemetry collector

{% include tracing-shipping/otel_bug_june2021.md %}

Create a dedicated directory on the host of your ASP.NET Core application and download the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.23.0) that is relevant to the operating system of your host.


After downloading the collector, create a configuration file `config.yaml` with the following parameters:

{% include /tracing-shipping/collector-config.md %}

{% include /tracing-shipping/replace-tracing-token.html %}


##### Start the collector

Run the following command:

```shell
<path/to>/otelcontribcol_<VERSION-NAME> --config ./config.yaml
```
* Replace `<path/to>` with the path to the directory where you downloaded the collector.
* Replace `<VERSION-NAME>` with the version name of the collector applicable to your system, e.g. `otelcontribcol_darwin_amd64`.

##### Run the application

Run the application to generate traces.


##### Check Logz.io for your traces

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Tracing](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/jaeger).
