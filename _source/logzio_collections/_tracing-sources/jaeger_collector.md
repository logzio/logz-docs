## Overview

Logz.io's trace exporter for Jaeger allows you to ship distributed traces to Logz.io from different APM (Application Performance Management/Monitoring) agents, including Zipkin.

This topic explains how to install the Logz.io Jaeger Collector. 

For an overview of the process to send traces to Logz.io, see [Getting started with Logz.io Distributed Tracing](/user-guide/distributed-tracing/getting-started-tracing). 

We recommend that you use the OpenTelemetry collector to gather trace transaction data from your system. 
See [_Ship traces with OpenTelemetry_](/shipping/tracing-sources/opentelemetry) for the procedure to configure and deploy the OpenTelemetry collector. You may consider using the Jaeger Collector as a secondary option, if you experience issues with the OpenTelemetry Collector. 

#### Deploy Jaeger Collector with Logz.io Exporter

The Logz.io integration builds on the Jaeger Collector base image and uses the gRPC plugin framework to enable communication between the Collector and Logz.io.

<div class="tasklist">

##### Create a Docker network
Run the following command to create a Docker network: 

```yaml
docker network create net-logzio
```

To enable communication between the collector and the agent, include the name of the network you create in this step (for example, `net-logzio`) in the config file for each component. 

##### Configure the Logz.io extension
Configure the Logz.io extension with shell variables or environment variables. 

The required ports are described [here. ](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/deployment/#collectors) 
You'll need to change to the version page for your deployment. 

```yaml
docker run -e ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<<SHIPPING-TOKEN>>  # see parameter list below\
 --network=net-logzio \  # This is the name of the network you created in step 1 above.
 --name=jaeger-logzio-collector \ # This is the name of the collector
 -p 14268:14268 \
 -p 9411:9411 \
 -p 14267:14267 \
 -p 14269:14269 \
 -p 14250:14250 \
logzio/jaeger-logzio-collector:latest
```

###### Parameters

The complete list of Logz.io collector parameters is presented below. 

In addition to these parameters, you can also use [Jaeger's collector parameters](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/latest/cli/#jaeger-collector-grpc-plugin). 
You'll need to change to the version page for your deployment. 

 Collector Parameter | Description
 ------------ | -------------
  ACCOUNT_TOKEN (Required) | The account token is required when you use the collector to send traces to Logz.io. Replace `<SHIPPING-TOKEN>` with the token of the Distributed Tracing account you want to send data to. [_How do I look up my Distributed Tracing account token?_](/user-guide/accounts/finding-your-tracing-account-token)|
REGION | Two-letter region code that determines the suggested listener URL (where you will be sending trace data to).   Find your region code in the Regions and URLs table. This parameter is left blank for US East (Northern Virginia).  [_How do I look up the Listener host URL for my region?_](/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions)|
GRPC_STORAGE_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL| The lowest log level to send.  Default: **warn**.  From lowest to highest, log levels are: **trace, debug, info, warn, error**.  Controls logging only for the Jaeger Logz.io Collector.  Does not affect Jaeger components.|
COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT | If youâ€™re using a Zipkin implementation to create traces, set this optional environment variable to the HTTP port for the Zipkin collector service.|
