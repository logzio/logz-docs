Deploy this integration to enable automatic instrumentation of your Python application using OpenTelemetry.

### Architecture overview

This integration includes:

* Installing the OpenTelemetry Python instrumentation packages on your application host
* Installing the OpenTelemetry collector with Logz.io exporter
* Running your Python application in conjunction with the OpenTelemetry instrumentation

On deployment, the Python instrumentation automatically captures spans from your application and forwards them to the collector, which exports the data to your Logz.io account.

### Setup auto-instrumentation for your locally hosted Python application and send traces to Logz.io

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* A Python application without instrumentation
* An active account with Logz.io
* Port `4317` available on your host system
* A name defined for your tracing service


<div class="tasklist">

{% include /tracing-shipping/python-steps.md %}


##### Download and configure OpenTelemetry collector

Create a dedicated directory on the host of your Python application and download the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.33.0) that is relevant to the operating system of your host.

After downloading the collector, create a configuration file `config.yaml` with the parameters below.

* {% include /tracing-shipping/replace-tracing-token.md %}

```yaml
receivers:  
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  logzio:
    account_token: "<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>"
    #region: "<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>>" - (Optional): Your logz.io account region code. Defaults to "us". Required only if your logz.io region is different than US East. https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions

  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logzio]
```


##### Start the collector

Run the following command:

```shell
<path/to>/otelcontribcol_<VERSION-NAME> --config ./config.yaml
```
* Replace `<path/to>` with the path to the directory where you downloaded the collector.
* Replace `<VERSION-NAME>` with the version name of the collector applicable to your system, e.g. `otelcontribcol_darwin_amd64`.

##### Run the OpenTelemetry instrumentation in conjunction with your Python application

Run the following command from the directory of your Python application script:

```shell
opentelemetry-instrument python3 <YOUR-APPLICATION-SCRIPT>.py
```

Replace `<YOUR-APPLICATION-SCRIPT>` with the name of your Python application script.

##### Check Logz.io for your traces

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Tracing](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/jaeger).

### Setup auto-instrumentation for your Python application using Docker and send traces to Logz.io

This integration enables you to auto-instrument your Node.js application and run a containerized OpenTelemetry collector to send your traces to Logz.io. If your application also runs in a Docker container, make sure that both the application and collector containers are on the same network.

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* A Python application without instrumentation
* An active account with Logz.io
* Port `4317` available on your host system
* A name defined for your tracing service

### Overview

You can use a Helm chart to ship Traces to Logz.io via the OpenTelemetry collector. The Helm tool is used to manage packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that use charts.

**logzio-otel-traces** allows you to ship traces from your Kubernetes cluster to Logz.io with the OpenTelemetry collector.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This chart is a fork of the [opentelemtry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-collector) Helm chart.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->


#### Standard configuration

<div class="tasklist">

##### Deploy the Helm chart
 
Add `logzio-helm` repo as follows:
 
```shell
helm repo add logzio-helm https://logzio.github.io/logzio-helm
helm repo update
```

##### Run the Helm deployment code

```
helm install  \
--set config.exporters.logzio.region=<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>> \
--set config.exporters.logzio.account_token=<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
logzio-otel-traces logzio-helm/logzio-otel-traces
```

{% include /tracing-shipping/replace-tracing-token.html %}
`<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>>` - (Optional): Your logz.io account region code. Defaults to "us". Required only if your logz.io region is different than US East. https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions

##### Check Logz.io for your traces

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, then open [Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/).

</div>

####  Customizing Helm chart parameters

##### Configure customization options

You can use the following options to update the Helm chart parameters: 

* Specify parameters using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

* Edit the `values.yaml`.

* Overide default values with your own `my_values.yaml` and apply it in the `helm install` command. 

###### Example

```
helm install logzio-otel-traces logzio-helm/logzio-otel-traces -f my_values.yaml 
```

#### Uninstalling the Chart

The uninstall command is used to remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and to delete the release.  

To uninstall the `logzio-otel-traces` deployment, use the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall logzio-otel-traces
```
