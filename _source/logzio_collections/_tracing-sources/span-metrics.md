[Service Performance Monitoring](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/service-performance-monitoring) is a high-level monitoring dashboard within Logz.io that enables you to monitor your tracing services and operations. This integration allows you to configure Service Performance Monitoring with OpenTelemetry collector and send spans and span metrics from your OpenTelemetry installation to Logz.io. 


### Architecture overview

This integration is based on OpenTelemetry. It works as an add-on to existing OpenTelemetry installations. If you need to set up OpenTelemetry first, refer to our documentation on [OpenTelemetry](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/tracing-sources/opentelemetry).
  
The integration includes:

* Configuring the OpenTelemetry collector to receive spans generated by your application instrumentation and send the spans and span metrics to Logz.io

On deployment, your OpenTelemetry instrumentation captures spans from your application and forwards them to the collector, which exports the spans and span metrics data to your Logz.io account.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This integration uses OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib, not the OpenTelemetry Collector Core.

### Set up your locally hosted OpenTelemetry installation to send spans and span metrics to Logz.io

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* An application instrumented with an OpenTelemetry instrumentation or any other supported instrumentations based on OpenTracing, Zipkin or Jaeger 
* A metrics account [setup](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/service-performance-monitoring-setup#create-a-metrics-account)
* An active account with Logz.io
* A Logz.io span metrics account

##### Download and configure OpenTelemetry collector

Create a dedicated directory on the host of your application and download the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/tag/v0.59.0) that is relevant to the operating system of your host.

After downloading the collector, create a configuration file `config.yaml` with the following parameters:

##### Run the container
  
When running on a Linux host, use the `--network host` flag to publish the collector ports:

```shell
docker run --name logzio-spm \
-e LOGZIO_REGION=<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>> \
-e LOGZIO_TRACES_TOKEN=<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
-e LOGZIO_METRICS_TOKEN=<<SPM-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
--network host \
logzio/otel-collector-spm
```  

When running on MacOS or Windows hosts, publish the ports using the `-p` flag:

```shell
docker run --name logzio-spm \
-e LOGZIO_REGION=<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>> \
-e LOGZIO_TRACES_TOKEN=<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \

###### Optional parameters

If required, you can add the following optional parameters as environment variables when running the container:
  
| Parameter | Description | 
|---|---|
| LATENCY_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS | Comma separated list of durations defining the latency histogram buckets. Default: `2ms`, `8ms`, `50ms`, `100ms`, `200ms`, `500ms`, `1s`, `5s`, `10s`   | 
| SPAN_METRICS_DIMENSIONS | Each metric will have at least the following dimensions that are common across all spans: `Service name`, `Operation`, `Span kind`, `Status code`. The input is comma separated list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions, for example: `region,http.url`. Each additional dimension is defined by a name from the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes. If the named attribute is missing in the span, this dimension will be omitted from the metric.   | 
| SPAN_METRICS_DIMENSIONS_CACHE_SIZE | The maximum items number of `metric_key_to_dimensions_cache`. Default: `10000`. | 
| AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY | Defines the aggregation temporality of the generated metrics. One of either `cumulative` or `delta`. Default: `cumulative`. | 

  
##### Run the application

{% include /tracing-shipping/collector-run-note.md %}


Run the application to generate traces.


##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Tracing](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/jaeger). Navigate to the **Monitor** tab to view the span metrics.

### Overview

You can use a Helm chart to ship metrics and span metrics from your OpenTelemetry installation to Logz.io. The Helm tool is used to manage packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that use charts.

**logzio-otel-spm** allows you to ship traces from your Kubernetes cluster to Logz.io with the OpenTelemetry collector.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
This chart is a fork of the [opentelemtry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-collector) Helm chart. The main repository for Logz.io helm charts are [logzio-helm](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-helm).
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->



#### Standard configuration
  
**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* An application instrumented with an OpenTelemetry instrumentation or any other supported instrumentations based on OpenTracing, Zipkin or Jaeger 
* A metrics account [setup](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/service-performance-monitoring-setup#create-a-metrics-account)
* An active account with Logz.io

<div class="tasklist">

##### Deploy the Helm chart

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
If you are already running a Helm chart logzio/otel-collector-traces, the new image logzio/otel-collector-spm will replace it.
{:.info-box.note}
<!-- info-box-end -->

Add `logzio-helm` repo as follows:
 
```shell
helm repo add logzio-helm https://logzio.github.io/logzio-helm/logzio-otel-spm
helm repo update
```

##### Define the logzio-otel-traces service dns


In most cases, the service name will be `logzio-otel-traces.default.svc.cluster.local`, where `default` is the namespace where you deployed the helm chart and `svc.cluster.name` is your cluster domain name.
  
If you are not sure what your cluster domain name is, you can run the following command to look it up: 
  
```shell
kubectl run -it --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/jessie-dnsutils:1.3 --restart=Never shell -- \
sh -c 'nslookup kubernetes.default | grep Name | sed "s/Name:\skubernetes.default//"'
```
  
It will deploy a small pod that extracts your cluster domain name from your Kubernetes environment. You can remove this pod after it has returned the cluster domain name.
  
##### Point your traces exporter to logzio-otel-traces

In the instrumentation code of your application, point the exporter to the service name defined in the previous step, for example `http://logzio-otel-traces.default.svc.cluster.local:4317`.

##### Run the Helm deployment code

```
helm install  \
--set logzio.region=<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>> \
--set logzio.tracing_token=<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
--set logzio.metrics_token=<<SPM-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
logzio-otel-spm logzio-helm/logzio-otel-spm
```


{% include /tracing-shipping/replace-tracing-token.html %}
  
{% include /tracing-shipping/replace-spm-token.html %} 


`<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>>` - Your logz.io account region code. Defaults to "us". Required only if your logz.io region is [different than US East](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions).

##### Check Logz.io for your traces

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, then open [Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/).

</div>

####  Customizing Helm chart parameters

##### Configure customization options

You can use the following options to update the Helm chart parameters: 

* Specify parameters using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

* Edit the `values.yaml`.

* Overide default values with your own `my_values.yaml` and apply it in the `helm install` command. 
 

###### Example

```
helm install logzio-otel-traces logzio-helm/logzio-otel-traces -f my_values.yaml 
```
  
###### Optional parameters

If required, you can add the following optional parameters as environment variables:
  
| Parameter | Description | 
|---|---|
| config.processors.spanmetrics.latency_histogram_buckets | Comma separated list of durations defining the latency histogram buckets. Default: `2ms`, `8ms`, `50ms`, `100ms`, `200ms`, `500ms`, `1s`, `5s`, `10s`   | 
| config.processors.spanmetrics.dimensions | Each metric will have at least the following dimensions that are common across all spans: `Service name`, `Operation`, `Span kind`, `Status code`. The input is comma separated list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions, for example: `region,http.url`. Each additional dimension is defined by a name from the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes. If the named attribute is missing in the span, this dimension will be omitted from the metric.   | 
| config.processors.spanmetrics.dimensions_cache_size | The maximum items number of `metric_key_to_dimensions_cache`. Default: `10000`. | 
| config.processors.spanmetrics.aggregation_temporality | Defines the aggregation temporality of the generated metrics. One of either `cumulative` or `delta`. Default: `cumulative`. | 

#### Uninstalling the Chart

The uninstall command is used to remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and to delete the release.  

To uninstall the `logzio-otel-traces` deployment, use the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall logzio-otel-traces
```
