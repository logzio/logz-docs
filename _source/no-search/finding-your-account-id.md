When you're working with Support
or purchasing a Logz.io plan through a partner,
you'll need to provide your account ID.

Here's how to retrieve it.
From the [**General settings**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) page
(**<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > General** in the top menu),
you'll find your account ID next to the _Account settings_ heading.
