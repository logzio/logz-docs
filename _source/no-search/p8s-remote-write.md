To send your Prometheus application metrics to a Logz.io Infrastructure Monitoring account, use remote write to connect to Logz.io as the endpoint. Your data is formatted as JSON documents by the Logz.io listener. 

### Planning ahead

If you have multiple Prometheus server instances, you'll have to add Logz.io as an endpoint for each instance. 

By default, all metrics in your Prometheus server(s) will be sent to Logz.io. To drop or send specific metrics, add Prometheus labeling before enabling the remote write, or as part of the remote write configuration.

* _in dev_: Set parallelism level for sending data - how many connections to open to the remote write listener. While the default is 1000, but we recommend configuring much fewer connections. 

* _in dev_: This is set in the configuration file. Parameter for # of connections (more data --o--> more channels)
  Sending data - best practice in configuring connection channels: 

* _in dev_: If you have both Prometheus & Grafana, you can activate a dashboard as part of the remote write configuration that will show you the queue size and how many metrics you're sending. If your queue size increases, it might be necessary to open an additional channel.

Once your metrics are flowing, export your existing Prometheus and Grafana dashboards to Logz.io Infrastructure Monitoring as JSON files.  

### Configuring Remote Write to Logz.io

1. Within Logz.io, look up the Logz.io Metrics Account token and Listener address for your region (URL).

    - Youâ€™ll find your Metrics account information in the <a href ="https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts" target="_blank">Manage Accounts **(<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts)**</a> page of your Operations workspace, when you click the relevant Metrics account to display its details.

    - Look up the correct Listener URL for your region in the <a href ="user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions" target="_blank">_Regions and Listener Hosts_</a> table. 
  
2. Within Prometheus, add a new remote_write URL for Logz.io to your Prometheus yaml file. 
    A logical location to add this information is under the `global_config` section, at the same indentation level as the `global` section.  <a href ="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write" target="_blank">Prometheus configuration file remote write demo <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>   </a>

    ```yaml
    global_config
      remote_write:
        - url: <the Logz.io Listener URL for your region>
          bearer_token: <your Logz.io Metrics account token> 
          remote_timeout: 30s
          queue_config:
            batch_send_deadline: 5s  #default = 5s
            max_shards: 10  #default = 1000
            min_shards: 1
            max_samples_per_send: 500 #default = 100
            capacity: 10000  #default = 500
    ```

    |Parameter | Description
    |url| Logz.io Listener address for your region
    |bearer_token| Logz.io Metrics account token
