You can migrate your Logz.io Log Management accounts to another hosting region.

### Implications

When the account is migrated to a new hosting region, it's important to note:

* Pre-migration data canâ€™t be transferred
* Pre-migration data can't be restored from the archive
* The migration will reset your account's data shipping tokens. Consequently, you will need to update your data shipping configurations with the new token and listener host/region details.

#### Migration checklist


##### Create a new account in the target region

Open a new Logz.io trial account in your region of choice.
[Upgrade your new account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/plan-and-billing/plan) to suit your needs.

##### (Re-)Create your sub-accounts

This step is only relevant if your pre-migration account has sub-accounts and you want to recreate them in your new, post-migration account.

Use the Logz.io API endpoints as follows:

1. In your pre-migration account, [retrieve the settings for all of your Log Management accounts](https://docs.logz.io/api/#operation/getAllDetailedTimeBasedAccount).
2. In your post-migration account:
  1. [Create a new sub-account](https://docs.logz.io/api/#operation/createTimeBasedAccount) with the matching settings. Repeat for each sub account.
  2. [Update your main account](https://docs.logz.io/api/#operation/updateTimeBasedAccount) with the appropriate settings and daily capacity.

If you prefer, the above process can be performed by API or manually. You may also consider writing a script to expedite the process.


##### Export & Import your Kibana objects

Export any and all Kibana objects you want to keep and import them into your new account. These include saved searches, visualizations, and dashboards. [Export & import guide](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/kibana/share-import-export)
