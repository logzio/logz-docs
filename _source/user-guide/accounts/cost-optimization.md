#### Filter your Metrics view


The Metrics overview includes two primary filters you can apply: **Account** and **Used**.

The **Account** filter includes all of the accounts associated with your user, and the **Used** filter helps you understand how the data is being used.

You can apply these filters quickly from within the table by clicking on the desired values.

To identify which metrics can be optimized, apply the **Not used** filter. The results will include all metrics not used by any dashboard or alert, which you can drop.
