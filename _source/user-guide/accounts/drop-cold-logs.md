Drop logs is available only as part of the Cold Search abilities. You have to pay for cold search in order to drop logs. What happens after you drop the logs? Can you search the dropped logs?





Drop filters offer a great way to filter out logs from an account to help manage your account volume and lower costs.

Drop filters evaluate logs for field:value exact matches. Incoming logs that match your account's active drop filters will not be indexed and will not appear in your OpenSearch Dashboards account. Dropped logs are not searchable, cannot trigger alerts, and will not appear in dashboards, reports, or anything else. However, dropped logs will be archived if you are archiving logs.

The following diagram explains how Drop filters are applied when sending data to Logz.io:

![Drop filters overview](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/drop-filters/drop-filter-flow.png)

You can turn drop filters on and off, as often as you like, making them ideal for logs that are only needed sometimes.

In general, drop filters are recommended for logs that are needed infrequently, while logs that are never needed should not be shipped at all.


<!-- ![Drop filters list](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/drop-filters/drop-filters.png) -->

To set up your Drop filters, select [**Data Hub > Drop filters > Logs**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/tools/drop-filters) from the navigation menu.

You can apply Drop filters to your logs, metrics, and traces.

## How much data can I filter?

* You can use Drop filters to drop as much as twice your plan's daily volume.
  In other words, drop filters can drop up to 200% of your daily volume.

  _For instance_:
  If you have 50 GB daily volume,
  you can index 50 GB and filter 100 GB per day.

* You can add up to 10 drop filters.

## Deactivating drop filters

Your account needs to have enough space
to accommodate logs
when you deactivate a drop filter.
If you expect to go over your daily limit,
please contact <a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">the Support team or your account manager</a>.

## Some important notes on drop filtering {#some-important-notes}

* **Dropped logs can't be searched in OpenSearch Dashboards and they can't trigger alerts.** \\
  All incoming logs are compared to your drop filters.
  Logs that meet your filter criteria are dropped,
  meaning they won't be parsed and indexed.

* **Dropped logs are still archived.** \\
  If you have [archiving]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/archive-and-restore/configure-archiving.html) enabled,
  your logs will be archived before they're dropped.
  This means that you can restore from your archives,
  even if the logs didn't originally make it to OpenSearch Dashboards.

* **Restored logs pass through drop filters.** \\
  If you're restoring logs from an archive,
  turn off drop filters if you want them to be indexed in your OpenSearch Dashboards account.
  When restoring,
  always make sure that the logs you need are not filtered out using drop filters.

* **Working with "dotted fields".** \\
  Applying drop filters when your logs include dotted fields is a more complicated scenario: Dotted fields don't work in a drop filter. To use a dotted field to trigger a drop filter, please contact the Logz.io Support team. 

  **Example** 
  In the image below, `"data.level"` is dotted, and not nested. The field`"data.level": "DEBUG"` can't be used to trigger a drop filter for the log.

## Set up a drop filter

To get started,
click **<i class="li li-plus"></i> Add drop filter**
to open the _New drop filter_ form.

![New drop filter form](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/drop-filters/new-drop-filter.png)

<div class="tasklist">

##### Choose a log type
{:.no_toc}

If you choose a **Log type**,
only logs of that type are dropped.

To include all log types, leave **Log type** blank.

##### Add fields to filter
{:.no_toc}

Add up to 3 **Field**:**Value** pairs to filter.
Each pair must be an exact match.
Drop filters are case sensitive.

###### An example
{:.no_toc}

Logs from a Docker container might contain this field-value pair:

```json
{ "docker.container.name": "system-logs" }
```

Those logs are only filtered
if we set **Field** to `docker.container.name`
and **Value** to `system-logs`.

If we set **Value** to anything else—such as `system`—those logs
are not filtered.

##### Confirm and save
{:.no_toc}

Before saving, it's important to know that all the logs that meet
your filter criteria will be dropped.

If you have [Archiving]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/archive-and-restore/configure-archiving.html) enabled,
your logs will be archived before they're dropped.

Select the confirmation check box,
and then click **Apply the filter**.
