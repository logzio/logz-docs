Each Logz.io plan has one main account, from which admin users can create and manage sub accounts.

![Manage accounts](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/flexible-volume-sub-accounts.png)

You can find the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page by clicking **<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts** in the top menu.

## Configuration options

* **Access control**

    You can control access to different sets of data by shipping your logs to different sub accounts, each with its own set of users. You can also use account default permissions to determine who can access and read the data.

* **Flexible capacity**

    You can make the most of your plan's indexing capacity by switching to flexible volume. Flexible volume makes it easier to ensure that accounts don't max out their indexing capacity. [Explore your options](/user-guide/accounts/flexible-volume.html)

* **Long term storage**

    Main accounts and sub accounts are time-based. Although time-based accounts are ideal for short- and medium-term data analysis, they hold your data for a limited amount of time.

    Using [data optimizers](/user-guide/optimizers/configure-optimizers.html), you can store data in a timeless account, allowing you to analyze long-term patterns and trends on aggregated data.
