Each Logz.io plan has one main account, from which admin users can create and manage sub accounts.
You can control access to different sets of data by shipping your logs to different sub accounts, each with its own set of users who can access it.

Main accounts and sub accounts are time-based.
Although time-based accounts are ideal for short- and medium-term data analysis, they hold your data for a limited amount of time.
Using [data optimizers]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/optimizers/configure-optimizers.html), you can store data in a timeless account, allowing you to analyze long-term patterns and trends on aggregated data.

You can find the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page by clicking **<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts** in the top menu.
