Each Logz.io plan has one main account, from which admin users can create and manage sub accounts. You can control access to different sets of data by shipping your logs to different sub accounts, each with its own set of users who can access it.

Main accounts and sub accounts are time-based. Time-based accounts are ideal for short-term data analysis. Using [data optimizers]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/optimizers/configure-optimizers.html), you can store data in a timeless account. This allows you to analyze long-term patterns and trends.

To manage your accounts, click [**Manage Accounts**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-users) in your admin settings (<i class="li li-gear"></i> in the top menu).
