You can manage your Cloud SIEM accounts
from the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page.
You'll need to be signed in to the main account in your Operations workspace.

If you're interested in adding a Cloud SIEM plan,
reach out to your account manager
or email [the Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).

#### To manage your Cloud SIEM accounts

Each Security account is a separate entity, with its own users, rules, and feeds.
Security accounts canâ€™t access each other's dashboards, rules, private feeds, or data.

##### Add a Cloud SIEM account

You'll find your Cloud SIEM accounts
in the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page
of your Operations workspace. Scroll down towards the bottom of the page to see them.

Click **Add Security account** to open the form.
The number of accounts you can create is listed.

##### Configure your new account

![Manage the Cloud SIEM account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/add-security-accounts.png)


Fill in the form:

1. **Name** (or rename) the account.
2. **Enable Cloud SIEM on these accounts** - Select the log accounts to be secured. You'll be giving the security account **read permissions** so it can monitor and enrich the logs.

    Logs are not shipped directly to your Cloud SIEM accounts. Instead, you'll grant read-access to log accounts you want a security account to monitor.

  You can add the same log account to multiple Security accounts. It will be monitored by each Security account independently.

##### Save your changes

When you first add a new account, give it a few minutes to finish setting up.
