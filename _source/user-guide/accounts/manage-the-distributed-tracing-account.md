You can manage your Distributed Tracing account
from the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page.
You'll need to be signed in to the main account in your Operations workspace.

If you don't have a Distributed Tracing account yet, start a trial in the Distributed Tracing tab.
