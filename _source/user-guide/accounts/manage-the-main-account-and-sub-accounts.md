#### View Log Management plan summary

Your Log account is calculated based on the data you ingest. You can choose to use a [flexible volume](/user-guide/accounts/flexible-volume.html) to get more control over how you allocate space and data between your accounts.

You can view the total number of daily GB available and the account's retention. This summary also includes a detailed list of the available accounts, their reserved daily GB, and whether these accounts are capped, searchable, and if they include shared objects.

![Log plan overview](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/log-management-overview.png)

#### View and edit account details

To see the detailed information and the configurable options for each account, click the account name in the table or pie chart.

![Log accounts overview](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/log-management-choose-account.png)

Inside each account, you can view and edit the following details:

* Account name (which you can change by editing it and clicking the **Apply** button)
* Account token
* Account retention duration
* Reserved volume (and whether to cap this account's volume)

You can add the following elements:

* Save account utilization metrics (and how often)
* Save the account's log size 
* Which accounts/sub accounts have visibility to the data in this account

![Logs accounts details](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/log-management-account-inner.png)

#### Configure which accounts can access a Logs data source

Each log account can become a data source for other Logz.io Log Management accounts. To manage access to your data, you create an access list of the Logz.io main account and sub accounts that can view the data. 

##### To grant access to the data in a Logs account

Users that are logged in to the accounts you add here will be able to read the data in this account.

1. Click the account name to open its account details.

2. To enable access from other accounts, click Add an account and select the relevant accounts.

![Logs add account visibility](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/log-management-add-account.gif)


### Main vs. sub account

If you're on a Pro or Enterprise plan, you can create sub accounts to help manage user access to your data.

Sub accounts help you control data usage and manage user access to your logs.

You can define data volumes and retention periods for independent environments by shipping different logs to different sub accounts.

Sub accounts can also help you control access to sensitive data.

By default, all users of your main account have permission to view the data in other logging sub accounts and timeless accounts. You can route different logs to different sub accounts to limit access to data.

### Add and manage a Log Management sub account

Sub accounts share the same setting options as the main account (See the list above). In addition, sub accounts have settings used to control access to the data.

To add a sub account, navigate to the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page, and click the **Add sub account** button located in the upper left corner of the Log Management account plan panel.

![Add sub account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/add-sub-account.png)

Choose the sub account name, retention, and volume options if relevant. On the right hand side, you'll have additional options for this sub account, including:


| Settings | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enable main account users to access this account** | If enabled, all main account users will automatically have user-role permissions to the sub account. This means they can view the log data in the sub account. If disabled, users will need to be explicitly added to the sub account to have access to it. |
| **Searchable from the main account** | If enabled, data stored in the sub account, can be searched directly from the main account in Kibana. |
| **Save account utilization metrics** | Logs metrics on your account utilization, such as used and expected data volume at current indexing rate (GB). |
| **Save log size** | Adds the logSizeEnabled field to each log, stating the log's size. |
| **Use dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches from these accounts** | Choose the main account from which these elements will be visible on the sub account. Useful if you want to be able to access your main account's data from this sub account. |
{:.paramlist}

Click **Apply** to create the sub account.

If you already have a sub account and you'd like to re-configure it, choose the relevant sub account from the list and click on **Advanced options** to access these settings.

![Manage existing sub accounts](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/manage-sub-account.gif)

#### Delete a sub account from your plan

Choose the Log Management sub account you want to delete, and click the **Delete** icon located next to its name. 

Then, confirm (or Cancel) the action.

#### Change how many GB are reserved for each account within your plan

You can edit the amount of GB reserved for each of your Log Management accounts.

Choose the relevant account you'd like to edit, increase or decrease the reserved volume assigned to it, and click **Apply** to save your changes.

<div id="timeless">


While your main account and sub accounts
are better suited for short-term monitoring of your log data,
they're not really a cost-effective way to view long-term patterns and trends.
That's where timeless accounts come in.

Timeless accounts work with optimizers,
allowing you to save a subset of your logs for as long as you need them.
You can store key metrics that you want to track in your timeless accounts.
Each timeless account contains its own Elasticsearch index,
which you can search from your main account.

![Timeless accounts](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/accounts--timeless-accounts.png)

##### To create or manage a timeless account

<div class="tasklist">

##### Select or add a timeless account

In the **Timeless account plan** panel,
click the timeless account you want to manage,
or click **Add timeless account**.

![Manage a timeless account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/accounts--manage-timeless-account.png)

##### Adjust account volume

If you need to adjust the **Timeless account volume**,
type in the text box
or use <i class="li li-plus"></i> and <i class="li li-minus"></i>.

Your plan allows for a maximum data volume.
Keep this limit in mind when you allocate resources to your timeless accounts—you won't be able to exceed the limits of your plan. \\
\\
Contact your Logz.io account manager if you need to increase your plan limits.
{:.info-box.note}

##### Set search permissions

If you want your sub accounts to be able to search this account,
add the intended accounts to the **Read & write permissions** box.

##### Save your changes

Click **Apply** to save your changes.

#### View the plan summary and account allocations

Your Tracing account is based on spans: a building block of a trace, a named, timed operation representing a piece of the workflow in distributed systems.

You can view your monthly available spans, your plan's data retention time, and a breakdown of each account's current month's allocations and usage percentages.

![Tracing account summary](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/seetracingaccounts1.png)

#### View details and options for a specific account

To see the detailed information and the configurable options for each account, click the account name in the table or pie chart. 

![View account details](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/seeaccount-details.png)

You can view the following details:

* Account name and creation date 
* Account token
* Summary and breakdown of the spans sent to the account over the last 7 days

And change the following account options: 

* Tracing account name
* Which Logz.io main account and [sub accounts](/user-guide/accounts/#main-vs-sub-account) can access the data in any of the multiple tracing accounts (which are data sources)
* Total spans allocated from the Distributed Tracing plan to this specific data source, which defines how many spans per calendar month can be ingested into this data source
* Remaining portion of the overall Distributed Tracing plan that can still be allocated to additional tracing data sources (accounts) 

#### Update the account name

Enter a new **Tracing account name** and **Save** to update your changes, or **Cancel** to discard them.

![Rename a tracing account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/newtracingname.png)

#### Configure which accounts can access a tracing data source

Each Distributed Tracing account can function as a data source for other Logz.io accounts.
To manage access to your tracing data, you create an access list of the Logz.io main account and sub accounts that can view the span data for each tracing account. You can see the list of all the sub accounts (and main account) in the top right of the application page, in the account selector.

When users are logged in to an account in the access list,
they can choose the tracing account as a data source in the Jaeger interface of the Tracing tab.
![Pick a data source](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/distributed-tracing/tracing-data-source.gif)

**To grant access to the data in a tracing account**

  1. Click the account name to open its account details. 
  ![Manage tracing account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/accounts-manage-tracing-subaccts4.png)


  2. To enable access to a Distributed Tracing data source for other accounts, in the field below the **Tracing account name**, click **Add an account**, and select the relevant accounts. 
  ![Access to tracing account data for other accounts](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/accounts-access-4tracing-subaccts3.gif)


#### Add a tracing account to your plan

You can configure up to 5 tracing accounts for your Distributed Tracing plan. If you need the ability to add more tracing accounts, reach out to your account manager or [the Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).
{:.info-box.note}

**To create a new account**

1. Click **Add Tracing account** in the upper left of the Distributed Tracing Account plan panel.
2. Name the new account
3. Set which accounts can use it as a data source in the Tracing tab. 
4. Configure the **Total monthly spans** to allocate to the new account. 
   If you don't have spans available to allocate to the new plan, you'll be prompted to reduce the allocation of another account.
   ![Reduce existing span allocation](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/reduce-allocation.png)

5. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

![Adding a new tracing account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/add-new-tracingacct.gif)

#### Delete a tracing account from your plan
 
1. In the account details, click the **Delete** icon next to the account name.
  ![delete](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/delete-tracing1.png)   

2. Confirm (or **Cancel**) the action. 
  ![Confirm delete](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/confirm-delete-tracingacct2.png)


#### Change how many spans are allocated to each Distributed Tracing account within your plan

Juggle the allocated spans per month of your Distributed Tracing account plan between the different tracing accounts according to each account's current usage details. Each data source has its quota defined in the **Spans** column. 

![overview of allocated spans](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/spanscolumn.png)

To change how many spans are allocated to a tracing account, pick the relevant account, increase or decrease the **Total monthly spans** and click **Save** to apply your changes.

In the example below, **New Tracing Account 2**  is not using its allocated spans: It would be reasonable to reduce its monthly allocation and increase the allocation for the **Tracing** account. 
![juggle allocated spans](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/shiftspans-betweenaccts2.png)

#### Tracing surge protection

Your Distributed Tracing accounts are limited by a monthly quota of a number of spans, representing your Distributed Tracing plan. 

To avoid a situation in which your monthly quota runs out too fast because of unnoticed spikes, Logz.io introduced a **surge protection** mechanism for Tracing accounts.

The surge protection is volume-based (as opposed to the span number-based quota), aimed to cover different scenarios in which your accounts run out of quota too fast.

The calculation is estimating your span size to be 2KB (it usually is less):

* Monthly spans quota / 30 = Estimated number of daily spans.
* 4 X Estimated number of daily spans X 2KB = Estimated daily spans volume.

If your Tracing account's overall daily size (volume) exceeds the **Estimated daily spans volume** - the Tracing account will stop ingesting spans for this day (ending midnight UTC). This means you can send about 4 times of the average daily spans amount.

When an account exceeds 80% of the allowed daily volume, account admins will receive an email alert indicating an unusual traffic event in the Tracing account, providing extra time to examine the issue before the ingestion stops.

#### Troubleshooting

If your Tracing account exceeded its quota, the first thing you'll need to do is check that the overall quota is assigned to your account.

Navigate to **[Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts)** and scroll to find your **Distributed Tracing plan**. You'll see how many spans you currently have and their distribution across your account.

![Distributed Tracing account overview](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/distributed-tracing/dt-account-plan-overview.png)

In this example, the overall quota is 600M monthly spans, when only 50M are allocated to the **Sock Shop Tracing** account.

You can add more spans from the overall quota to prevent your Tracing account from getting suspended, increasing both your monthly and daily limit for this account.

If you have several Tracing accounts but don't have any available spans from your monthly quota, you can allocate spans between the different accounts.

![Distributed Tracing allocation](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/distributed-tracing/dt-account-allocation.png)

In this example, all of the monthly spans quota is divided between 2 Tracing accounts. 

By moving 100M monthly spans to the **Sock Shop Tracing DEV** account, you can prevent the dev account from getting suspended.

![Distributed Tracing reallocation](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/distributed-tracing/dt-reallocation.png)

If there are no available spans to allocate, you can contact [Logz.io Support team](mailto:help@logz.io) to temporarily increase the quota limit.

Each Security account is a separate entity, with its own users, rules, and feeds.
Security accounts can only access each other's dashboards, rules, private feeds, or data if you enable and configure how these objects can be shared.

If you're interested in adding a Cloud SIEM plan,
reach out to your account manager
or email [the Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).
{:.info-box.note}

### Manage your Cloud SIEM account

* [Add a Cloud SIEM account](/user-guide/accounts/manage-the-main-account-and-sub-accounts.html#add-a-cloud-siem-account)
* [Configure or update your Cloud SIEM account](/user-guide/accounts/manage-the-main-account-and-sub-accounts.html#configure-or-update-a-cloud-siem-account)
* [Delete a Cloud SIEM account](/user-guide/accounts/manage-the-main-account-and-sub-accounts.html#delete-a-cloud-siem-account-from-your-plan)


#### Add a Cloud SIEM account

You'll find your Cloud SIEM accounts
in the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page
of your Operations workspace. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see them.

Click **Add Security account** to open the form.
The number of accounts you can create is listed.

![Add a Cloud SIEM account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/add-security-account11.png)


#### Configure or update a Cloud SIEM account

![Configure a Cloud SIEM account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/config-security-account.png)


Fill in the form:

1. **Name** (or rename) the account.
2. **Enable Cloud SIEM on these accounts** - Select the log accounts to be secured. You'll be giving the security account **read permissions** so it can monitor and enrich the logs.

    Logs are not shipped directly to your Cloud SIEM accounts. Instead, you'll grant read-access to log accounts you want a security account to monitor.

    You can add the same log account to multiple Security accounts. It will be monitored by each   Security account independently.
    {:.info-box.note}

3. **Automatically pull dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches from these Security accounts** - Select which security accounts you can automatically pull shared objects from. 

  ![Shared security objects](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/
add_new-account.gif)

  The security account you're configuring will automatically be able to access the Kibana dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches from the source accounts you add to this list, but will *not* have access to the data in these accounts.  
  
  This is helpful if you have multiple main accounts. 
  
  For example: 

  + Instead of creating the same objects for each account, you can just share them! 
  + You can use this process to keep a local backup copy of these data objects. 
  + Create a library of data objects in your main Security account, and then enable client accounts to use objects from your main account.  

#### Save your changes

Click **Create**/**Apply** to save your changes.

When you first add a new account, give it a few minutes to finish setting up.


#### Delete a Cloud SIEM account from your plan 
 
1. In the account details, click the **Delete** icon next to the account name.
  ![delete](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/accounts/delete-SIEM.png)
