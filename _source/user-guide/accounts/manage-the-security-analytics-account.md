When Logz.io detects a security event in your system,
it creates a log entry in your Security Analytics account.
Logs are not shipped directly to your Security Analytics account.
Instead, you'll grant read access to the other accounts you want to monitor.

If you don't have a Security Analytics account yet,
reach out to your account manager or email [the Sales team](mailto:sales@logz.io).

You can manage your Security Analytics account
from the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page.
You'll need to be signed in to the main account in your Operations workspace.

#### To manage your Security Analytics account

<div class="tasklist">

##### Select your Security Analytics account

You'll find your Security Analytics account
in the [Manage accounts](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) page
of your Operations workspace,
at the bottom of the page.

If you want, change the **Security account name** here.

##### Set read permissions

Give **Read permissions** for any accounts you want to monitor.

Your Security Analytics account will watch the logs of these accounts.

Any security events are stored as their own logs in Security Analytics.
