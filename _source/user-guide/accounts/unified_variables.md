**Unified Variables** represent a collection of fields from within your code. It lets you normalize data type names from multiple data sources combined into one parameter.

These variables are the engine behind [Unified Filters](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/unified_filters.html), an additional feature that provides a comprehensive overview of your systems and applications.

<p class="info-box note">Only account admins can create, edit, and toggle Unified Variables. Account users can view the variables and their fields.</p>

#### Configure a Unified Variable

<div class="tasklist">

##### Name the variable

Navigate to **[Metrics](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics)** > **[Unified variables](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/global-variables)** > **[New variable](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/global-variables/new)**. Alternatively, click the **+** sign next to the Unified variables option in the side navigation. Give your Unified Variable a useful name to understand the fields it represents.

##### Add fields

Fields represent existing variables in your code and systems. Choose the field you'd like to include in the unified variable, and the data sources and accounts in which it appears.

<p class="info-box note">Each data source/account can only be used once per Unified Variable.</p>

</div>


#### Create, edit and toggle

Navigate to the main Unified Variables screen to view all of the existing variables.

Account admins can toggle each variable on/off, and hovering over each one reveals additional options, such as edit, duplicate or delete.

You can use your Unified Variables as part of Logz.io **[Unified Filters](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/unified_filters.html)** feature.
