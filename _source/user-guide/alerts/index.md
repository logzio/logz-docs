Logz.io alerts are based on a search query in Kibana.
By customizing alerts and setting threshold levels,
you can ensure that you're notified of critical events.
You can configure alerts to see non-urgent events in Kibana,
reducing alert fatigue while still having a complete view of noteworthy events.
