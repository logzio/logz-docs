The **Triggered alerts** page offers an updated list of notifications of recently triggered alerts, as long as they were not suppressed.

You can think of it as a live dashboard summary of all the triggered alert notifications sent.
So that even if you're not on the recipients list, you can still know which events occurred.

To view the **Triggered alerts** page,
select [**Logs > Triggered alerts**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/triggers/triggered-alerts)
from the top menu.

* To view the raw logs for a particular event, click the button **View in Kibana**.

  You'll be taken to Kibana Discover, with the logs filtered to return the exact logs that caused the alert to trigger. Using Kibana, you can explore your logs and get a better idea of the conditions that led to the triggered alert.

  This is the same link that appears in the alert notification.
