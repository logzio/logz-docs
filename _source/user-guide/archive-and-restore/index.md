Archiving provides a cost-effective solution for long-term storage of logs that don't need to be instantly searchable. You can configure Logz.io to archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or a Microsoft Azure Storage account.

When you need to investigate old logs after they have expired from your account, you can restore them to a temporary account with no additional storage costs.

Restored accounts are complimentary, and do not count against your daily log volume.
