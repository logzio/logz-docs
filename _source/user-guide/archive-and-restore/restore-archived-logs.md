![Restore a new account](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/archive-and-restore/restored-accounts.png)

When you restore archived logs,
those logs are re-ingested into a temporary account. You can search restored accounts directly from your main account.
Restoring archived logs allows you to see your data in its original detail,
so you can investigate events in Kibana that are older than your plan’s retention period.


### Known limitations

* The max data to restore is equivalent to your account's daily **reserved volume**, and no more than 100 GB.
* If the restore process exceeds the max, the process will fail.
* Data can be restored from the **root of an S3 bucket**, but not a sub-bucket path.
#### To restore and view archived logs

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
[Archiving enabled](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/tools/archive-and-restore),
archived logs in your S3 bucket

##### Make your preparations

There are a few things you need to check before you begin the process.

1. Double-check your [Drop filters]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/drop-filters/) to make sure logs you need won't be filtered.

    If you're planning to restore logs that could be dropped by your drop-filters, you'll need to first make the necessary changes to your drop-filters before restoring. Otherwise the logs will just be dropped right after they are restored, and before   they reach your Logz.io account.

2. The max data you can restore per restore process is equivalent to your account's daily **reserved volume**, and no more than 100 GB.
  
    If the limit is exceeded, the restore will **fail at the end of the process**.

    It's best to restore data for the smallest time frame, to ensure that the volume of data to be restored will not approach the max limit.

##### Restore your archives

In the _Restore_ tab, give your restored account a **Name**, choose a **Time range** of up to 24 hours, and click **Restore**.

The time it takes to restore your archives depends on a few factors,
so there's no way to know how long your re-ingestion will take.

You'll receive an email when the restored account is ready.

As an informal guideline, if you're restoring an hour's worth of data, go have a cup of coffee.
If you're restoring a day's worth of data, take a long lunch break.

##### Explore the restored account in Kibana

Open the email that says your restored account is ready for you and click **View in Kibana**.
This link takes you to Kibana in your main account, but a view that shows only the data from the restored account.

If you need to filter Kibana manually,
choose the new restored account in the **Selected Accounts** box,
and then select your data's original **Time Range**.

Now you're ready to search your restored account!
Just be aware of the expiration—once the restored account expires after 5 days, you'll have to restore it if you need it again.
