Summary
: The first thing you see when you sign in to your security account.
  The summary dashboard shows the last 24 hours of events that Logz.io found in your log data.

Threats
: The Threats dashboard shows you potential threats by correlating your logs with lists of known threats using publicly available threat feeds.

Kibana & Dashboards
: Use Kibana to drill down into your logs, or select dashboards to review.
  Cloud SIEM helps you quickly investigate specific events and threats.

Send your data
: A quick guide to walk you through the first steps for getting your logs into the system.

Reports
: Schedule reports to be sent out on a regular basis.

Rules
: Manage your SIEM's preconfigured rules, or add your own.
  When a security rule triggers, a security event is logged
  and written to the relevant dashboards as well as the Summary and Threats dashboards.
