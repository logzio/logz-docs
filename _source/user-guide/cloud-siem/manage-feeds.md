There are two types of threat feeds in Cloud SIEM:

* Logz.io threat feed is a predefined threat feed. It is included by default and cannot be edited. Logz.io threat feeds have a **Logz.io feed** tag.

* Private threat feed is a feed that you can add to the Cloud SIEM. You can add, edit or delete a private feed. Private feeds have a **Private feed** tag.
