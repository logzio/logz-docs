Cloud SIEM has an integrated platform for security events management. Here you can view security events that have occured, edit them, assign a security rule to a team member. You can filter the list using the top menu filters and the search bar.

The event manager has a retention period of 2 weeks. Older events are saved as logs on your security account and can be viewed from your OpenSearch Dashboards.
