Security rules help you connect the dots between your data sources and events that could indicate a security threat or breach.
Your Cloud SIEM account comes preconfigured
with security rules for different attack types
and security use cases.

You can create new security rules to supplement the built-in rules.
You can also update any preconfigured rule at any time, including adding a notification endpoint (like email or Slack) or changing trigger thresholds.

#### To create a new security rule

![Query bar in the Research page]({{site.baseurl}}/images/security-analytics/security-analytics--research-query-bar.png)

##### Set your query in Kibana

In the [Research](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/research) page,
type a query in the query bar, and press Enter.
Review the results in the histogram and the document table,
and make sure your query returned the expected results.

Click **Create Rule** (to the right of the query bar).
The _Create a New Rule_ page is shown.

Continue with [To configure a security rule](#to-configure-a-security-rule).

##### Name and tag the rule

Type a **Name** and a detailed **Description**.

Add **Tags** to help categorize this alert.

##### _(Optional)_ Edit the search settings

If you need to, change your **Query**.

If you use an invalid query,
the rule will be automatically disabled.
Run your query in Kibana so you can be sure you're getting the expected results.

##### _(Optional)_ Edit group by settings

![Security rule group by settings]({{site.baseurl}}/images/security-analytics/security-analytics--correlation-rule-group-by.png)

Click **Add group by** to add up to 3 groups.

In the **Select Field** list,
choose a field to group by.

To limit the available fields,
choose a log type from the **Filter by type** list.
To show fields for all log types, choose **Clear filter**.

##### Set threshold and severity levels

Set your threshold and severity levels in the **Trigger** section.

![Security rule trigger settings]({{site.baseurl}}/images/security-analytics/security-analytics--correlation-rule-trigger-settings.png)

##### _(Optional)_ Set recipients

If you want to receive notifications or emails when the rule is triggered,
choose an endpoint.
If you donâ€™t choose an endpoint, events will still be logged:

Choose the endpoints or email addresses to notify.
If you need help adding a new endpoint,
see [_Notification endpoints_]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/integrations/endpoints.html).

Choose a time period to suppress notifications.

Click **Save** to save your rule.

If the threshold is passed and the rule is triggered, Logz.io logs the event and sends the configured notifications.
