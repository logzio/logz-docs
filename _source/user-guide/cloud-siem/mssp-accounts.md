As an MSSP you can create a dedicated SIEM account for each logging account. This lets your customers access their data without the risk of accidentally seeing other customers’ data.

To do this:


1. Sign in to Logz.io as an administrator user.

2. Go to **Settings > Manage accounts**.

3. In the **Plan Summary** section, select **Add sub account**.

   * Give the new account a required name.

   * Select the required retention period for the account.

   * Select the required volume for the account. The default value is 1 GB.

   * Select the checkbox to enable the main account users to access this account.

   * Select the checkbox to make the account searchable from the main account.

   * If required, select the checkboxes to save the account utilization metrics and log size.

   * If required, add account names from which you want the new account to use dashboards, visualizations and saved searches.

4. Select **Create**.

5. Scroll down to **Cloud SIEM plan**.

6. Select **Add security account**.

   * Give the new account a required name

   * In the **Enable Cloud SIEM on these accounts** menu, select the account you created in the previous steps.

   * If required, add account names from which you want the new account to use dashboards, visualizations and saved searches.

7. Select **Create**.

8. Go to **Cloud SIEM**.

9. Click the account selection menu in the top right corner of the **Summary** screen.

10. Select the new account. It takes a few minutes to get the account set up.
