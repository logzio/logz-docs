##### [Deploy tracing components](/user-guide/distributed-tracing/deploying-components.html)
Decide on your tracing source, make deployment decisions, and decide whether or not to use an agent to send tracing data to Logz.io.

##### [Set up instrumentation](/user-guide/distributed-tracing/tracing-instrumentation.html)
Determine the best instrumentation strategy for your system: Manual or automatic instrumentation.

If you’re deploying distributed tracing on Kubernetes, we recommend the following blog post: [A Guide to Deploying Jaeger on Kubernetes in Production](https://logz.io/blog/jaeger-kubernetes-best-practices/).
