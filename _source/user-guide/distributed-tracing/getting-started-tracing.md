Get set and get ready: This section describes what you have to do to get set up - before you can use Distributed Tracing in Logz.io.

If you already have Jaeger installed locally, learn how to go about [Making the switch from your local Jaeger installation to Logz.io Distributed Tracing](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/local-jaeger_transition).


#### To set up Distributed Tracing:

##### Set up instrumentation
Determine the best instrumentation strategy for your system: Manual or automatic instrumentation.
<a href="https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/distributed-tracing/tracing-instrumentation.html" target ="_blank"> Read more about setting up instrumentation.</a>

##### Look up your Distributed Tracing token and Region information in Logz.io

###### Tracing token
{% include tracing-shipping/tracing-token.md %}

###### Region information
{% include tracing-shipping/region-code.md %}


##### Deploy tracing components
Decide on your tracing source, make deployment decisions, and decide whether or not to use an agent to send tracing data to Logz.io.

If youâ€™re deploying distributed tracing on Kubernetes, we recommend the [Kubernetes deployment reference](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/user-guide/distributed-tracing/k8s-deployment) topic.
