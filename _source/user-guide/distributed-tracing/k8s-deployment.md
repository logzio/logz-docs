If you're working with Kubernetes, you can ship your traces to Logz.io using a Helm chart, via the OpenTelemetry collector.

The following guide will walk you through how to get your Tracing account token and how to configure and send your Helm chart to Logz.io.

The main repository for Logz.io helm charts are [logzio-helm](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-helm).

##### Ship your traces to Logz.io

Logz.io uses a Helm chart to send traces from your Kubernetes cluster via the OpenTelemetry collector. 

Select **[Send your traces](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/collection?tag=all&collection=tracing-sources) [> Kubernetes](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/tracing-sources/otel-traces-helm)** and follow the steps to deploy the chart and trace your data.

##### Check the Distributed Tracing tab for your traces.

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, then check the Distributed Tracing tab in Logz.io to see the traces in the Jaeger UI.
