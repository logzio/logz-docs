This view lets you visualize a distributed request trace. Flamegraph groups services together, providing a high-level summary of execution time. Each horizontal bar represents a service, color-coded and time-stamped according to how long it took to complete the operation.

When applying the Trace Flamegraph view, you get an overview of the relationships between service calls, errors, and latency data inside the different services. As a result, you can pinpoint, analyze and attend to services that require your attention.

Use Flamegraph when you want to focus on a single trace by selecting the relevant view on the top right menu:
