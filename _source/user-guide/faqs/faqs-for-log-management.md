You've heard it before, but we'll say it again: At Logz.io, customer obsession is in our DNA. We're here to make cloud observability easy, valuable, and cost effective. 

# Integrating with your service or application

## Q: Can we integrate with {the name of your service or application}

## TL;DR - The short version

### A: Integrating with your 3rd-party application or service
+ If the logs are only viewable within the service or application, the answers is most likely "noâ€œ, since there would be no way to have the logs index on our clusters.
+ If the logs are accessible from outside your service or application, then it's much more likely that you can ship those to Logz.io - depending on how that access is managed.

### Integrating with your proprietary application or service
Logz.io offers a variety of [Send Your Data integrations](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data?tag=from-your-code&collection=log-sources) to enable you to ship logs directly from your code based on the language you're using.

This information is also available in the Logz.io Docs, via [**Ship data > Logs**](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/#log-sources), when you select the **From your code** filter.
