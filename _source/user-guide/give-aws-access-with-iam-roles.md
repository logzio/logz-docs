Connect Logz.io to your AWS account using IAM roles.
This gives Logz.io the appropriate level of access
while keeping your AWS account secure.

###### To grant access to an S3 bucket

1.  Copy Logz.io details

    Copy the **Account ID** in your text editor, and create an **External ID** and copy it as well.

    Enter the **S3 bucket name** and, if needed, **Prefix** where your logs are stored.

    Click **View and copy role policy**.
    You can review the role policy to confirm the permissions we need.
    Paste the policy in your text editor.

    Keep this information available so you can paste in AWS in step 2.

2.  Create the role

    Browse to the [IAM roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles)
    and click **Create role**.
    You're taken to the _Create role_ wizard.

    Click **Another AWS account**.

    Paste the **Account ID** you copied from Logz.io.

    Select **Require external ID**, and then paste the **External ID** you made in Logz.io.

    Click **Next: Permissions** to continue.

3.  Create the policy

    In the  _Create role_ screen, click **Create policy**.
    The _Create policy_ page loads in a new tab.

    In the **JSON** tab,
    replace the default JSON with the policy you copied from Logz.io.

    Click **Review policy** to continue.

    Give the policy a **Name** and optional **Description**, and then click **Create policy**.

    Remember the policy's nameâ€”you'll need this in the next step.

    Close the tab to return to the _Create role_ page.

4.  Attach the policy to the role

    Click <i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> (refresh), and then type your new policy's name in the search box.

    Find your policy in the filtered list and select its check box.

    Click **Next: Tags**, and then click **Next: Review** to continue to the _Review_ screen.

5.  Finalize the role

    Give the role a **Name** and optional **Description**, and then click **Create role**.

6.  Copy the ARN to Logz.io

    In the _IAM roles_ screen, type your new role's name in the search box.

    Find your role in the filtered list and click it to go to its summary page.

    Copy the role ARN (top of the page).
    In Logz.io, paste the ARN in the **Role ARN** field, and then click **Save**.

To give Logz.io access to more S3 buckets with the same role and policy,
you'll need to use the same external ID.
You can find your role's external ID under the **Trust relationships** tab in the role summary page.
