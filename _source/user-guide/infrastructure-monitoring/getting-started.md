Logz.io Infrastucture Monitoring complements the ELK stack
with advanced tools for viewing and managing your metrics.

**The _Welcome_ dashboard**

When you first log into Logz.io Metrics,
  you'll see a dashboard that gives you an overview of your account.
  This dashboard shows your account usage,
  metrics count,
  and any errors we encountered when indexing your metrics.

**Pre-built dashboards**

Your Logz.io Metrics account comes pre-loaded with dashboards 
  that work with your data sources out-of-the-box,
  no configuration required.
  Most of these dashboards include the
  [drilldown links]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/configure-grafana-drilldown-links.html)

Select the dashboard and the data source to begin.
