Your Metrics account offers several ways to correlate data between your Logz.io Grafana and Kibana accounts:

1. Annotations can mark events on your Metrics dashboards based on data from a logging account. [Learn more about Annotations](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/annotations/).

2. Drill down links offer a quick way to get from a Grafana visualization to the relevant logs in Kibana. [Learn more about **Explore in Kibana** links](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/explore-in-kibana-drilldown-links).
