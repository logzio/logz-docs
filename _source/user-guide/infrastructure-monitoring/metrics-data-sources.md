We've put together a short list of the basics for managing your metrics data:

* [Packaging your code to send custom application metrics](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/custom-metrics).
* [Understanding downsampling and data compaction over time](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/data-rollups.html). This is important for selecting max/min/sum/avg variables as data points and interpreting dashboards.
* [Figuring out which data is available in your Metrics account](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/grafana-explore/).
* [Taking shortcuts using Logz.io's pre-configured dashboard templates](/user-guide/metrics/integrations.html). So you never have to start from scratch.
