Logz.io provides pre-configured metrics dashboards for many popular data sources. As soon as you start shipping data to Logz.io, the relevant dashboards will become populated with your data. The next step is to configure [alerts](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/alerts.html) and you're good to go!

Pre-configured dashboards:

{% for doc in site.metrics-sources | sort %}
* [{{doc.data-source}}]({{doc.url}})
{%- endfor -%}
