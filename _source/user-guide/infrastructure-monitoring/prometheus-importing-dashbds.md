You can import your existing Grafana dashboards to Logz.io via a manual process.
 
For the dashboard import to work smoothly, you'll need to change the name of the data source in your JSON file to the name of your Logz.io Metrics account. 
Your Metrics account information is located in the <a href ="https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts" target="_blank">Manage Accounts **(<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts)**</a> page of your Operations workspace. ![Account settings navigation](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/grafana/p8s-account-token00.png)

For the record, notification endpoints and dashboard annotations are not imported: You'll need to recreate them in Logz.io.  See [Notification endpoints](/user-guide/integrations/endpoints.html) and [Annotations ](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/annotations/)for more information.
