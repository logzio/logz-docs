Logz.io Metrics solution is powered by Prometheus. This topic will help you get started with PromQL on Logz.io, and presents some examples and use cases for your environment.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
PromQL does not support the `*` wildcard that Lucene queries use. 
Instead, use `"~"` before the value you want to search, and `".+"` at the end of it.

<!-- info-box-end -->

### Let's query

To search all of the time series data points in your dashboard, run the following query:

`count({__name__=~".+"}) by (__name__)`

To search for a specific time series point, add the relevant value to the query:

`{__name__=~"value.+"}`

For example, to get all of the time series data points that starts with the value **container**, use the following query:

`{__name__=~"container.+"}`

Searching a label inside a time series changes the query. Add the name of the time series, and the value you're looking for:

`nameOfTimeSeries{label=~"value.+"}`

In this example, the time series you're querying has the following labels:

* namespace
* container
* pod
* user

To search for a namespace label that starts with **kub**, run the following query:

`container_memory_working_set_bytes{namespace=~"kub.+"}`

If you're not sure what metrics your dashboard contains, which labels it includes, or the values you can search for, click **Metrics browser** to view all of the data, and build the query that fits your needs.
