The Insights feature uses machine learning to detect new exceptions and critical errors, and highlights these events for further investigation. If you ship logs from CI/CD, you can set markers so you can see exceptions and error messages on the same graph as changes to the environment.

You can use insights to sift through the noise in your logging infrastructure so you can see a full, contextual story of what's happening in your system.
