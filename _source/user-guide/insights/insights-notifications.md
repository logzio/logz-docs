You can configure Logz.io to send a notification when Insights detects a new exception for the first time. 
An Insight notification is sent upon the first occurrence of the Insight for the account. 

Currently, Slack endpoints and email are supported. 
Any alert endpoints that you've already configured are also available for Insight notifications.

#### To configure Insights notifications

On the [Insights](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/insights) page, click **Notifications** on the upper-right corner.

In the **Recipients** list, select the recepient endpoints and email addresses.
