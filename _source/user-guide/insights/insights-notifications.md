You can configure Logz.io to send out a notification when new insights are detected for the first time. 
Logz.io Insights generally point out significant exceptions, errors, and issues identified from the account's logs. 

Insight notifications can currently be sent via Slack endpoints and email.  

Alternatively, if you'd rather not subscribe to insight notifications, you can open [Insights](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/insights) and investigate account insights based on their **first occurrence**.

#### To configure Insights notifications

On the [Insights](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/insights) page, click **Notifications** on the upper-right corner. 

In the **Recipients** list, select the relevent endpoints and email addresses, or configure a new endpoint.
