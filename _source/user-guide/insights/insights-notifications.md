You can configure Logz.io to send out a notification when
a new insight is detected for the first time.
Logz.io Insights leverages machine learning to point out significant exceptions, errors, and issues identified from the account's logs.

Insight notifications can be sent via Slack endpoints and email.

If you don't want notifications, but are interested in learning when insights were first identified,
you can open the [Insights](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/insights) tab
and investigate insights by their **first occurrence**.

#### To configure Insights notifications

On the [Insights](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/insights) page, click **Notifications** on the upper-right corner.

In the **Recipients** list, select the relevent endpoints and email addresses, or configure a new endpoint.
