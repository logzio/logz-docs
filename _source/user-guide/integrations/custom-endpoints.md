Configure a custom endpoint to send Logz.io notifications to your preferred apps,
even if they aren't on the list of preconfigured options.

Custom endpoints offer the advantage
of allowing you to customize the message body too.

#### To add a custom endpoint

<div class="tasklist">

#### Start the endpoint

To add a new custom endpoint, click **Add endpoint**.
Specify the URL, method, and headers.
For POST/PUT methods, you can configure the message body, if relevant.

#### Test the endpoint

Click **Run the test** to test your endpoint.
Logz.io shows if the message was successfully sent.

Check that the endpoint received the message.

This is not required, but highly recommended.

#### Save the endpoint

Click **Save** to save your endpoint.
