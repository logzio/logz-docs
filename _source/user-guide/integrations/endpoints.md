#### To manage notification endpoints

You can manage your endpoints
from [**Alerts & events > Alert endpoints**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/alerts/endpoints).
You can also add new endpoints when you're configuring a new notification.

* To add a new endpoint, click **Add endpoint**,
  fill in the required information,
  and click **Save**.

  For example, to add an Opsgenie endpoint, you'll need to select **Opsgenie** from the dropdown list, name the endpoint, and fill in your Opsgenie API key.

* To edit or delete an endpoint,
  hover over the endpoint,
  and click <i class="li li-pencil"></i> (edit)
  or <i class="li li-trash"></i> (delete).

Alerts are sent on ports 80 and 443 only.
Setting a custom port as part of an endpoint URL
will result in alerts not being sent to said endpoint.

* To test an endpoint after it's created, open it in edit mode. 
Click **Run the test** and make sure the test message was received. 
Logz.io will notify you if the message couldn't be sent, 
but you'll need to confirm that the message was received.
