Kubernetes 360 is part of Logz.io's Open 360, a unified platform combining a true log analytics solution, the best Prometheus metrics monitoring, and the value of distributed tracing powered by Jaeger.

Kubernetes 360 lets R&D and engineering teams monitor and troubleshoot applications deployed in Kubernetes environments.

The platform utilizes Kubernetes' numerous advantages for R&D and dev teams, allowing you to monitor application SLOs in a simple, efficient, and actionable manner. Kubernetes 360 offers flexibility and visibility while providing service discovery, balancing load, and allowing developer autonomy and business agility.

#### Getting started with Kubernetes 360

To activate your Kubernetes 360 dashboard, connect your Kubernetes data quickly and easily through Logz.io's **[Telemetry Collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new)**.

If you already have Kubernetes 360 data in your Logz.io account or prefer connecting Kubernetes manually, follow our **[Kubernetes 360 Prerequisite](/user-guide/k360/kubernetes-360-pre.html)** guide.

Once everything is up and running, you can use your Kubernetes 360 application.


#### Kubernetes 360 overview

You can switch your view to filter by the following resources: **Nodes**, **Deployments**, **Daemonset**, **Statefulset**, or **Job**.

[image]


When switching between views, the main cards change to represent the different resources. Each card includes several essential measurements, such as average CPU and memory usage, and a rundown of the resource’s status. The cards help you quickly identify which resources require your attention by marking failings or issues in red.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/focus-on-deployment.png)


<!-- The **node view** includes a summary of each node's physical CPU, memory, and disk. It also has a rundown of the inner pods’ status similar to the deployments view, including how many pods are failing, whether they’re using a high CPU or memory, the number of restarts, and the log error rate.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/focus-on-nodes.png) -->

You can dive deeper into each card by clicking on it, opening the **[Quick view](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#quick-view)** menu.

#### Customize your application

You can change and adjust Kubernetes 360 application to match your monitoring and troubleshooting needs. To help you get started, we'll break down the different options, how you can access them, and how they can help you and your team.

![Dashboard breakdown](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/overview-k360.png)

<div class="tasklist">

##### Clusters
{:.no_toc}

Choose which cluster you want to review. The dropdown menu includes all clusters in your Kubernetes account, bundled under their respective accounts.

##### Namespace
{:.no_toc}

Environments with many users, teams, or projects use a namespace to bundle relevant clusters and nodes. This filter allows you to focus on all elements inside a specific namespace.

##### Auto refresh
{:.no_toc}

Your Kubernetes 360 application is set to **auto refresh every 60 seconds** to provide you with the most recent data. Hover over the refresh button to see when the data was last updated.

Click on the button to stop the auto refresh. This allows you to investigate an issue or focus on your Kubernetes environment's current state. Click on the button again to turn auto refresh on.

![autorefresh button](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/autorefresh.png)

##### Change your metrics view
{:.no_toc}

By default, Kubernetes 360 provides an overview of your current environment. Use the bottom menu to focus on different metrics according to your monitoring needs:

* **Status** - Understand which pods are running, failing, pending, or which pods succeeded.
* **CPU** - View CPU consumtions by percentage: 0-50%, 50%-80%, 80%-100%, or over 100%.
* **Memory** - Know how much memory each pod uses: 0-50%, 50%-80%, 80%-100%, or over 100%.
* **Restarts** - Get a numeric overview of how many restarts occurred in each pod: 0, 1-10, 11-20, or over 20 restarts.
* **Log Error Rate** - Analyze the percentage of log errors that occurred and how many pods were affected. [_How do we calculate the log error rate?_](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#calculating-log-error-rate)

#### Investigate through quick view 

##### See Metrics
{:.no_toc}

Whether you’re viewing a deployment, node, or pod, you can easily investigate the different issues you might encounter. 

Each quick view menu contains the **View Metrics** button, allowing you to view the relevant information in a Grafana application. This can provide a focused overview of the chosen element, allowing you to pinpoint what happened and when it started quickly.

##### See Logs
{:.no_toc}

Node and pod views include the **See Logs** button, which opens an OpenSearch Dashboard screen with the relevant query to display the log information.

If you've set up your Kubernetes account manually, you might get an empty query with no results. In this case, you can use a custom filter to view all related logs.

Click on **Add filter** at the top of the screen. The fields vary according to your chosen view; add `kubernetes.host` to the field to view Node related logs. To view Pod related logs, add `kubernetes.pod_name` to the field.

Next, choose the operator. For example, you can select **exists** to view all of the related logs.

##### Locate
{:.no_toc}

To re-focus your view, click the **Locate** button at the top of the quick view menu. This will scroll back to the specific deployment, node, or pod you're investigating.

![Locate button](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/locate-button.gif)

##### Logs tab
{:.no_toc}

Nodes and pods quick view menu has an additional **Logs** tab containing a table with all the logs related to the chosen node or pod. The table includes the total number of logs, the time they were ingested, the log level, and its message.

![Logs inside nodes](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/logs-inside-nodes.png)

You can sort the table by clicking on each header: **Time**, **Log level**, or **Message**. Click on the same header again to change your view to ascending/descending.

#### Additional information

###### Calculating Log error rate

To calculate percentage error, we take the percentage of errors in the last 15 minutes and the percentage of errors in the last 2 hours:

`Errors in the last 15 minutes <= Amount of errors in the last 2 hours`

For example, if in the last 15 minutes there were 10 log errors out of 200 total logs, it means that there's a total of 5% errors:

`10/200 * 100 = 5%`

And if in the last 2 hours there were 15 log errors out of 800 total logs, the percentage of errors will be 1.8%:

`15/800 * 100 = 1.8%`

So the log error rate you'll see will be 177.7%, based on the following formula:

`(5/1.8 * 100) - 100 = 177.7%`

Additional examples: 

* Last 15 minutes = 5 error logs out of 50 total logs = 5/50 * 100 = 10%
* Last 2 hours = 6 error logs out of 800 total logs = 6/800 * 100 = 0.75%
* Error rate = (10/0.75 * 100) - 100 = 1233.3%

Or:

* Last 15 minutes = 2 error logs out of 100 total logs = 2/100 * 100 = 2%
* Last 2 hours = 2 error logs out of 800 total logs = 2/800 * 100 = 0.25%
* Error rate = (2/0.25 * 100) - 100 = 700%

<!-- #### Kubernetes 360 overview

Kubernetes 360 application provides a quick overview of your current deployments and nodes.

You can switch your view to focus on **Deployments** or **Nodes** using the buttons at the top right.

The **deployments view** includes cards representing the different deployments, a quick overview of the deployment's average CPU and memory, and a rundown of the pods' status. You can quickly identify whether pods are failing, if they're consuming a high amount of CPU, memory, if they had multiple restarts, and the number of log error rates inside. The pods' colors indicate their current status, when red dots indicate an issue with this pod.
