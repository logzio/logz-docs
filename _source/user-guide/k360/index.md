## Getting started with Kubernetes 360

To activate your Kubernetes 360 dashboard, connect your Kubernetes data quickly and easily through Logz.io's **[Telemetry Collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new)**.

If you already have Kubernetes 360 data in your Logz.io account or prefer connecting Kubernetes manually, follow our **[Kubernetes 360 Prerequisite](/user-guide/k360/kubernetes-360-pre.html)** guide.

Once everything is up and running, you can use your Kubernetes 360 application.

<!-- ![Main dashboard](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/k360-jul-overview-numbers.png)-->

## Kubernetes 360 overview




<!-- The **node view** includes a summary of each node's physical CPU, memory, and disk. It also has a rundown of the inner pods’ status similar to the deployments view, including how many pods are failing, whether they’re using a high CPU or memory, the number of restarts, and the log error rate.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/focus-on-nodes.png) -->

You can dive deeper into each card by clicking on it and opening the **[Quick view](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#quick-view)** menu.

### Customize your application

You can change and adjust Kubernetes 360 application to match your monitoring and troubleshooting needs. To help you get started, we'll break down the different options, how you can access them, and how they can help you and your team.

![Dashboard breakdown](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/k360-jul-overview-numbers-.png)

<div class="tasklist">

##### Filters
{:.no_toc}

First, choose the environment you'd like to view. Environments with many users, teams, or projects use a namespace to bundle relevant clusters and nodes. This filter allows you to focus on all elements inside a specific namespace.

Next, choose whether to view the environment's clusters, nodes, or both. Each dropdown menu includes all clusters and nodes in the chosen Kubernetes account, and you can use the search bar to find and add nodes to your view easily.

##### View
{:.no_toc}

You can switch your view to filter by the following resources: **Node**, **Pod**, **Deployment**, **Daemonset**, **Statefulset**, or **Job**.

![switch view](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/filter-view-jul-.png)

In addition, you can also switch between the **Map** and **List** views, according to your monitoring needs. Note that the Pod view can only be seen as a list.

When switching between views, the main cards change to represent the different resources. Each card includes several essential measurements, such as average CPU and memory usage, and a rundown of the resource’s status. The cards help you quickly identify which resources require your attention by marking failings or issues in red.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/node-view-jul-.png)

You can dive deeper into each card by clicking on it and opening the **[Quick view](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#quick-view)** menu.


##### Search
{:.no_toc}

You can search your environment for specific elements you’d like to view. Note that the search focuses on the elements' names, not their status, cluster, namespace, etc.

##### Auto refresh
{:.no_toc}

You can set your Kubernetes 360 application to auto refresh every 60 seconds, to ensure you view the most recent data. To do so, hover over the refresh button and click the auto refresh toggle. You can also click on the button to manually refresh the data. 

![autorefresh button](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/toggle-auto-refresh.png)


##### Change your metrics view
{:.no_toc}

By default, Kubernetes 360 provides an overview of your current environment. Use the bottom menu to focus on different metrics according to your monitoring needs:

* **Status** - Understand which pods are running, failing, pending, or which pods succeeded.
* **CPU** - View CPU consumtions by percentage: 0-50%, 50%-80%, 80%-100%, or over 100%.
* **Memory** - Know how much memory each pod uses: 0-50%, 50%-80%, 80%-100%, or over 100%.
* **Restarts** - Get a numeric overview of how many restarts occurred in each pod: 0, 1-10, 11-20, or over 20 restarts.
* **Log Error Rate** - Analyze the percentage of log errors that occurred and how many pods were affected. [_How do we calculate the log error rate?_](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#calculating-log-error-rate)
* **Security risks** - Presents how many potential security risks are in each of your pods. 


</div>

## Quick view

Clicking on one of the cards or rows opens the quick view menu. This menu provides additional information about each element, allowing you to investigate and understand what’s happening inside your Kubernetes environment.

For each available view -  Deployment, Pod, Node, Dameonset, Statefulset, and Job - you can access the quick view to gain more information, such as: 

* **Cluster** - The cluster associated with the chosen view.
* **Namespace** - The unique namespace.
* **Status** - Indicates whether that condition is applicable, with possible values **True**, **False**, or **Unknown**.
* **CPU** - Amount of CPU used. If the CPU is not capped, you'll see an indicator stating **no limit**.
* **Memory** - An average calculation of how much memory is in use.
* **Uptime** - The duration of how long the chosen view has been running.
* **Security risks** - The number of potential security risks. 

And more. 

![Pod upper menu Overview](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/pod-upper-overview-sep.png)

Each view lets you dive deeper into the data by using the links at the top of the quick view. Click on **See Metrics**, **See Traces**, or **See Logs** to navigate directly to the relevant view.

### Quick view tabs

To enrich your existing and newly sent data, use the [Telemetry Collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new) to configure and send data quickly, followed by the [Easy Connect](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/ezkonnect.html) platform to effectively instrument Kubernetes applications with OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation.

#### Track Deployment Data
{:.no_toc}

You can enrich your Kubernetes 360 graphs by adding an indication of recent deployments, helping you determine if a deployment has increased response times for end-users, altered your application's memory/CPU footprint, or introduced any other performance-related changes.

To enable deployment tracking ability, run the [**Telemetry Collector**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new) on your Kubernetes clusters. You can also activate this process **manually** by installing [Logz.io Kubernetes events Helm chart](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/integrations/Kubernetes:~:text=user%20guide.-,Send%20your%20deploy%20events%20logs,-This%20integration%20sends). 

Once enabled, the graphs will include a deployment marker, marked by a dotted vertical line.

You can view additional deployment data by clicking on the line. This data includes the deployment time, the associated service and environment, and a quick link to view the commit in your logs.

Click **Go to commit** to access and view your own code related to this deployment, allowing you to probe deeper into the relevant data.


To activate the **Go to Commit** button, go to **your app or service** and add the following annotation to the metadata of each resource's versioning you want to track: https://github.com/`<account>`/`<repository>`/commit/`<commit-hash>`. For example: `https://github.com/logzio/logzio-k8s-events/commit/069c75c95caeca58dd0776405bb8dfb4eed3acb2`.

## Additional information

### Calculating Log error rate

To calculate percentage error, we take the percentage of errors in the last 15 minutes and the percentage of errors in the last 2 hours:

`Errors in the last 15 minutes <= Amount of errors in the last 2 hours`

For example, if in the last 15 minutes there were 10 log errors out of 200 total logs, it means that there's a total of 5% errors:

`10/200 * 100 = 5%`

And if in the last 2 hours there were 15 log errors out of 800 total logs, the percentage of errors will be 1.8%:

`15/800 * 100 = 1.8%`

So the log error rate you'll see will be 177.7%, based on the following formula:

`(5/1.8 * 100) - 100 = 177.7%`

Additional examples: 

* Last 15 minutes = 5 error logs out of 50 total logs = 5/50 * 100 = 10%
* Last 2 hours = 6 error logs out of 800 total logs = 6/800 * 100 = 0.75%
* Error rate = (10/0.75 * 100) - 100 = 1233.3%

Or:

* Last 15 minutes = 2 error logs out of 100 total logs = 2/100 * 100 = 2%
* Last 2 hours = 2 error logs out of 800 total logs = 2/800 * 100 = 0.25%
* Error rate = (2/0.25 * 100) - 100 = 700%
