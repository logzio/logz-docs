When you sign in to the Logz.io app, the first thing you'll see is the Discover page in Kibana. 

The Discover page offers enough flexibility to explore your recent logs through filter and sort controls, the query bar, the document table, and an interactive histogram.

## Search

You'll find the query bar at the top of the Discover page. Type your query using the [Lucene query syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax), and then press Enter. The results of your search are shown in the document table and the histogram.
