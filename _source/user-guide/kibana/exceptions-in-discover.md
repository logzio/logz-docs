Logz.io Insights Engine automatically surfaces exceptions and highlights them in your logs.

So as you're troubleshooting in Kibana Discover, you can easily see the number of exceptions found in your log results for every query you run. The list is always in-context, and specific to the log results returned by your search.

To review the Exceptions, switch to the Exceptions tab and expand the Exceptions that interest you. to see the narrowed-down list of pinpointing the issues.
