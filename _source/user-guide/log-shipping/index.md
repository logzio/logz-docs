Before you can search your logs in Kibana, you'll need to ship them to Logz.io.
There are many ways to get your logs to our system.
Choosing the best method can depend on a variety of factors.

For instructions on supported log shipping methods, see [Log shipping sources]({{site.baseurl}}/shipping/).
