Telemetry Collector is currently **available in all regions** except for Japan and Australia. If you're located in these regions, you can use **[Logz.io’s data shippers](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/collection?tag=all&collection=all)** to send your data.
{:.info-box.note}

To start sending your AWS data through the Telemetry Collector, Log into your **main** Logz.io account, navigate to [Send your data](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data), and click on **Start collecting**.


To configure the Telemetry Collector, you must be logged into your **main** Logz.io account.

This integration is only compatible with Amazon Linux version 2 on EC2. The use of version 1 is deprecated.

<div class="tasklist">

##### Select your environment

Select the AWS platform and the relevant sub-type through which you want to send your data.

![Select platform](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/telemetry-agent/collector-main-aws-sep.png)

##### Select data sources

Each AWS environment requires different elements to collect your data.

* **AWS Logs** - Select your region, AWS services, and Custom Log Groups.
* **AWS Metrics** - Select your region and AWS namespace.
* **EC2 Monitoring** - Auto collects the data. Logz.io uses OpenTelemetry to monitor your EC2.

![Select data source](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/telemetry-agent/configure-aws-sep.png)

##### Define your collector

You can edit your collector’s name and description and choose which Logs, Metrics, and Tracing accounts to use. If you don’t have active accounts, you’ll be able to review the newly generated account names before continuing.

Click **Generate collector** to continue.

##### _Optional_ - Define your EC2 collector

You can configure the data sources the Telemetry Collector will collect. To do so, after choosing the EC2 Monitoring option, click on **Advance settings** at the top of the page. Next, you can edit and change the location of your logs, and whether you want to monitor both logs and metrics.

##### Install the Telemetry Collector


Login to your AWS account, launch the AWS stack to run stack configuration and click the **Run AWS stack** button to activate your collector. 

Some platforms might require additional details, such as admin privileges or passwords, to complete the installation. These details are not sent to or stored by Logz.io.

It might take a while for the Telemetry Collector to get up and running, after which you’ll be able to view your logs, metrics, or traces and get full observability into your system.
