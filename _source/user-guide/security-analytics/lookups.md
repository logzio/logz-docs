Lookups are reference lists that you can use to filter Kibana results or to power your security rules.
Using lookups, you can maintain whitelists and blacklists of data sets you want to filter by, such as users, IP addresses, regions, or domains.

You can use lookups as a single-sourced data set for multiple searches and security rules.
For example, you can create a lookup that contains a list of company IP addresses and then update the lookup as your IP addresses change over time.
All searches and security rules that use this lookup will compare logs to the updated listâ€”so you'll avoid the mistake-prone process of maually copying your data everywhere it's used.

You can find lookups by selecting [**Rules > Lookups**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/rules/lookup) from the top menu of your Security Analytics account.

###### Create or delete a lookup

* Click **New lookup** to create an untitled lookup.
  Give your new lookup a **Name** and optional **Description**.
  Your changes are automatically saved when you press Tab to advance to the next form field.
* To delete a lookup, **Delete** for that lookup.

###### Update a lookup

* To add a new item to your lookup, type a **Value** and an optional **Note**, and then click **Add**.
* Click **Edit** to change an item's value or note and then **Save** your changes, or click **Cancel** to revert your changes.
* Click **Delete** to delete an item from the lookup.

###### Using lookups in Kibana and security rules

1. Add a Kibana filter with your lookup

    <video autoplay controls loop width="500">
      <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/videos/lookups/add-lookup-in-kibana.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>

    In the [**Research**](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/research) tab, click **Add a filter**.

    Choose a field to filter by.

    Choose **in lookup** or **not in lookup** from the **Operators** list, and then choose the lookup your want to filter by.

2. _(Optional)_ Create a security rule

    Click **Create Alert** to make a new security rule with your filter.
    If you need help with creating a new security rule, see [Manage security rules]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/security-analytics/manage-security-rules.html).
