There are many convenient ways to collaborate in your Logz.io logging account.
Here are a few popular options:

1. [Share dashboards with colleagues or clients who don't have access to your Logz.io account]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/tokens/sharing-links.html). Populated dashboards can be shared as **snapshots** or **saved objects**. The logs are being shared.

2. [Share dashboards across accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/logs/share-import-export). This option "migrates" the dashboard without any data. The logs are not being shared.


Visualizations and saved searches can be shared as well in similar ways. Wherever we refer to dashboards here, we do so for simplicity. Dashboards, visualizations and saved searches are all OpenSearch Dashboards objects, and offer many of the same sharing options.
