If you're an Enterprise or Pro plan subscriber,
your account includes API access.
You have full control over your tokens to create and delete them at any time.

To revoke a token's permissions, delete the token.

#### Working with API tokens

* To create an API token, click **+ New API token**. Type a brief **token name** and click **Add**.
* To delete an API token, hover over it, and click **delete** <i class="li li-trash"></i> to delete it.

  Deleting a token affects any integrations that use that token. Make sure you update integrations that use a token you deleted.
