When you're setting up data shipping to your Metrics account, you'll need to include your Metrics shipping token. The token routes your data to the right account in Logz.io.

Here's how to get it.

From your main account, go to the [Manage accounts page](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts). It can be reached by selecting **<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage accounts**.

Scroll down to the Metrics account section,
and click the account you want to ship to.
The account's token and other settings will be shown.
