### Log data usage

From November 2021, Logz.io started migrating customers from indexing log measurement to ingestion log measurement.

Previously, data usage was based on log indexing. Log indexing usage measurements were subject to changes after processing and final analysis, which led to a lack of clarity regarding the amount of data received by Logz.io.

Ingested data is measured as your logs are received, after data parsing has been applied, and prior to data indexing.  This measurement does not change and provides a more accurate value for data usage.

For questions or further clarification, contact your Logz.io Account Manager or Customer Success representative via Intercom.
