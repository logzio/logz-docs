Logz.io supports multi-factor authentication for all users on a main account or sub account.
To enable this feature, an account admin needs to contact the Support team.

All users in your account must have Google Authenticator installed on their phones to be able to sign in.
Logz.io emails users to tell them when multi-factor authentication is enabled.

#### To set up multi-factor authentication for your account

<div class="tasklist">

##### Request multi-factor authentication from Logz.io

<a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">Contact the Support team</a>.
Write that you want to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

MFA is applied to your main account and each sub account separately.
Include the [account token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) for each account that you want MFA enabled on.

The Support team will tell you when multi-factor authentication is enabled.

##### Log out of Logz.io

Once Support enables MFA, log out of Logz.io.
The next time you log in, you'll see a QR code.

<!-- Do yourself a favor and scan the QR code in this image. You won't be disappointed. -->

##### Scan the QR code

Scan the QR code using Google Authenticator, type your verification code, and click **Verify**.

In future logins, Logz.io will prompt you to enter your Google Authenticator verification code.
