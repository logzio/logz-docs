## Permissions for main account admins

Admin users of the main account have these permissions:

* Create, view, update, and delete users in the main account and sub accounts,
  including other admin users.
* Create, view, update, and delete sub accounts.
* Create, view, update, and delete timeless accounts.
* Create, update, and delete log shipping tokens, shared tokens and API tokens.

Because of the high level of permissions,
we recommend limiting the number of admin users in the main account.
