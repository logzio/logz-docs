#### To set up single sign-on for Okta

<div class="tasklist">

##### Request SSO access from Logz.io

Only account admins can request single sign-on access for their accounts.
{:.info-box.note}

To kick off this process, send an email to [help@logz.io](mailto:help@logz.io).
Write that you want to set up Okta SAML SSO for Logz.io.
Include these items in the message:

* Your Logz.io [account ID]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/finding-your-account-id.html)
* The last six characters of your [account token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts)

The Support team will respond with the connection information you'll need to give in Okta.

##### Add Logz.io to Okta

In Okta, click **Admin**.

In the Shortcuts panel (on the right), click **Add Applications**.

On the left side of the window, click **Create New App**.
The "Create a New Application Integration" panel is displayed.

![Create a New Application Integration panel](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/sso-providers/okta/create-a-new-application-integration.png)

Select **Web** from the Platform list, click **SAML 2.0** option, and click **Create**.
The Create SAML Integration page is displayed.

Set your **App name** to "Logz.io". Click **Next** to continue to the Configure SAML tab.

Okta doesn't allow multiple groups to have the same name. To resolve this issue, it's best to change the name of the groups 

 Also, when searching in the resources tab under Security > Administrators if there are multiple groups with the same name, please note that Okta will only display five groups. This is an expected behavior.



Admins cannot create multiple groups with the same name in Okta. This is an expected behavior.




##### Paste the SAML information from Support

![SAML settings](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/sso-providers/okta/saml-settings.png)

Paste **Single sign on URL** and **Audience URI** from the Logz.io Support email message.

Don't change **Default RelayState**, **Name ID format**, or **Application username**.

![Attribute Statements](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/sso-providers/okta/attribute-statements.png)

In the Attribute Statements section:

* Set **Name** to "email"
* Select "Unspecified" from **Name format**
* Set **Value** to "${user.email}"

##### Configure Okta to send user groups

![Group Attribute Statements](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/sso-providers/okta/group-attribute-statements.png)

In the Group Attribute Statements section:

* Set **Name** to "groups"
* Select "Unspecified" from **Name format**
* Type an expression for the groups that you want to have access to Logz.io in **Filter value**.
This field can't be blank.

##### Zip the SAML certificate

On the right side of the page, click **Download Okta Certificate**.

Download the certificate file and zip it.
You'll attach this zip file to your next email to the Support team.

Click **Next**, select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**, and then click **Finish**.

##### Get your endpoint information

![SAML setup instructions](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/sso-providers/okta/view-setup-instructions.png)

Browse to the Sign On tab, and then click **View Setup Instructions**.

Copy the **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL**, and paste this in the email that you'll send to the Support team.

##### Send your SAML details to Logz.io

Draft a new [email to Support](mailto:help@logz.io), and include these items:

* Your zipped certificate (from step 5)
* Your Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL (from step 6)

##### _(Optional)_ Restrict Logz.io access to specific user groups

![Add group](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/access-and-authentication/sso--manage-groups.png)

By default, all Okta users with Logz.io access can sign in to your Logz.io accounts.

You can restrict this access from the [Manage users page](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-users) for each of your accounts.
To do this, click **Add group**, and then paste your group's name from Okta.
Do this for each group that should have access to this account.

##### Receive confirmation from Support

When Support has created your Okta + Logz.io connection, you're done!
You can start logging in to Logz.io through your Apps portal.
