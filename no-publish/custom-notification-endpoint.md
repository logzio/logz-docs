# Logz.io Integration

## What does Opsgenie offer Logz.io users?

The Logz.io platform allows customers to configure customizable alerts and take actions based on the chosen criteria in order to highlight or be notified of events of interest. With Logz.io Integration, Opsgenie acts as a dispatcher for these alerts, determines the right people to notify based on on-call schedulesâ€“ notifies via email, text messages (SMS), phone calls and iPhone & Android push notifications, and escalates alerts until the alert is acknowledged or closed.

## Functionality of the integration

When an alert is created in Logz.io, an alert is also created in Opsgenie automatically through the integration.
